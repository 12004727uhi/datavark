With my naked eye I saw a stationary dark orb in the sky (pic taken at 9:48 a.m.) It was not a bird, plane or helicopter. iPhones take terrible photos from a distance. The first photo is the original, the second is a zoomed-in version so the dark orb can be seen. Obviously you can take the original and zoom in yourself... the orb is just above the clouds which are slightly below and to the right of the sun. (I am NOT referring to the blue dot lower right which is some kind of reflection of the sun on my camera lens) It was especially interesting that it happened during a rocket launch. I'm thrilled to finally see one for myself.",{"entities":[[22,36,"GPE"],[75,88,"DATE"],[131,134,"TYPE"],[160,169,"TIME"],[336,339,"TYPE"],[417,420,"TYPE"]]}]]}
