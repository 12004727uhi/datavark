The only limiting factors we’re the 200-300feet of distance and the light being end of twilight, last glimpses of pink sky disappearing in the next 15 minutes. I could make our texture along with my girlfriend while driving in the highway to judge the approximate distance. It didn’t look like just dark spots that were impossible to judge size and distance. They looked about 50 feet in diameter. They were about 100 feet out to our right and had about 150-200 feet of elevation. I went to take a picture, but my iPhone 5s at the time was dead, so I hurried to grab my girlfriend iPhone 4s, we were driving on the highway, light wasn’t optimal for pictures with this limited camera tech at the time. But they did end up getting an article in HuffPost. You can just about make out the general what it is shape. I only wish the photos were .1% of what we both saw with our eyes. We had about 15 seconds of immediate/ close view when approaching and departing and maybe another 30-45 seconds of driving away view.",{"entities":[[27,37,"COLOR"],[54,60,"TYPE"],[194,198,"COLOR"],[228,239,"TIME"],[965,981,"TIME"],[1048,1069,"TIME"]]}],["https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rhode-island-couple-photo_b_4713910/amp",{"entities":[]}],["I have slight better pictures on my phone.
