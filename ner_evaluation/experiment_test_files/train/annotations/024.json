My windows were down (my 20 year old subie has no AC) To the north west just off the coast I noticed two intense white lights. My first thought was military aircraft. I’ve driven this route many times, day and night, and there are usually military aircraft flying around. The lights were traveling at a very low speed south east (so towards me). As I neared the lights, I could tell both of them were part of a single airborne craft. The craft itself was flying low somewhere between 300-700ft. I had to keep glancing back and forth between it and the road and as it got closer I could make out a faint shape, which was triangular and without a body—like a flying wing shape. The intense white lights were located at either end of the “wings”. At its closest to me it was almost directly above me and I had to hang my head out of the window (almost crashed) but at that moment I saw a smaller, rectangular blinking red light toward the back of the middle part of the craft.",{"entities":[[0,21,"DATE"],[22,26,"TIME"],[27,37,"GPE"],[54,68,"GPE"],[73,84,"GPE"],[236,241,"COLOR"],[242,249,"TYPE"],[325,328,"TIME"],[333,338,"TIME"],[399,405,"TYPE"],[485,491,"TYPE"],[743,757,"TYPE"],[787,791,"TYPE"],[811,816,"COLOR"],[817,823,"TYPE"],[1017,1028,"TYPE"],[1038,1041,"COLOR"]]}],["There is a part of me that thinks this might have been a military craft, given the proximity to the military bases, but I was so close to this thing and i am so certain of its shape. I have never seen a military craft like that. It was completely silent, and moving at a very low speed. I’m posting this hoping someone else might have seen it (the freeway was pretty busy and I’m absolutely positive somebody else witnessed the same thing). I was left with a very strange feeling and whether this was a conventional craft that I misidentified or something else, I would love to know.",{"entities":[]}]]}
