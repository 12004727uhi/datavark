From my vantage point, it appeared to be around 200-300 feet in the air and moving back and forth from left to right rather slowly for about 20 seconds over a tree line about 2 miles away. It then sat in one spot for about 7 minutes before descending elevation below the tree line, thus losing sight of it. I approximate its location to be about a mile or two southeast of Battleship Cove right over downtown Fall River from my vantage point right on the border of Tiverton RI and Fall River MA.",{"entities":[[34,39,"COLOR"],[40,45,"TYPE"],[69,79,"GPE"],[237,253,"TIME"],[319,334,"TIME"],[475,490,"GPE"],[511,521,"GPE"],[567,575,"GPE"],[576,578,"GPE"],[583,593,"GPE"],[594,596,"GPE"]]}]]}
