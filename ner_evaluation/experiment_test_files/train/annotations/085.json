Like it popped in and popped out of view instantly. I dismissed it until about 3 minutes later I saw a huge white plane with downward facing tail fins fly by. Like bigger than a 747 but looked like a reaper drone with its tail. Super weird. Anyone else see the plane? Maybe a ufo tracker?",{"entities":[[207,222,"TIME"],[242,247,"COLOR"]]}],["Edit; Long Island NY, posted here due to lack of photo as per guidelines",{"entities":[[6,17,"GPE"],[18,20,"GPE"]]}]]}
