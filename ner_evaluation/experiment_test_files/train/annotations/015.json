During this time I was out of work from a broken hand injury and which obviously gave me a lot of free time do whatever. I mostly spent my time skate boarding because I Didn’t have a car at that time, so basically I got every were in town on that thing.",{"entities":[[0,18,"DATE"],[19,26,"GPE"],[27,37,"GPE"],[131,140,"TYPE"]]}],["Since I couldn’t play video games because of my hand, I used to ride my board across town and hang out with my friends and I basically did this every day for a whole year. I wold usually just chill over my friends house and watch YouTube videos and other mutual friends would be over there. So basically I would get there in the day and ride my skateboard home which was like 3-4miles away, I took the same route every day which avoided the highway so I didn’t get hit by a car. I would cut through the neighborhood that was closest to my my neighborhood which had a softball little league and across from that which is a army reserve center. I would half walk in between the both because the road is so bumpy and takes-more energy than walking.",{"entities":[[322,332,"TIME"]]}],["December 15 2020 8:44 As Im going home I start rounding the corner going away from the soft ball field and reserve center there is something “Bright white” in the corner of my as I’m walking past a wall of Christmas lights , once I get to the corner of the block where the side walk dips it’s clear as day that there is a white pill/cigar shaped object completely still and the size of a large shuttle buss in the sky. The moment I computed I’m my on brain that this isn’t normal it got even scarier than I could have imagined. Because the moment I realized how “not right this is” the thing went from a stand still position an instantaneous fast speed. I’m gonna try to explain this into prospective, when a car wants to go to 100mph you have to pass all the speeds under that like 99 mph 98mph 97mph 96 mph and etc. but not this “tic tac” it was able to go from 0-15,000instantly and keep going at a steady pace while being completely silent.I literally witnessed this thing leave our visible atmosphere that way in a “ banana” shaped form. So yea that pretty much it I’ll never forget until the day that I die.",{"entities":[[0,16,"DATE"],[17,21,"TIME"],[149,155,"COLOR"],[322,327,"COLOR"],[328,338,"TYPE"],[831,840,"TYPE"]]}]]}
