We were located about 300 miles off lousiana doing longlining. It was about 4pm i saw a disturbance maybe 500 yards ahead. It looked like a bunch of whales at the surface. I decided to navigated towards them see them. Well when we got closer maybe 100 yards (football field distance) the scene transformed to what resembeled very big rapids. This was very very unsual and I have never seen something like this before. When we moved closer we saw that the rapids were like a big circle. Imagine a big circlular radius of big rapids. We all just watched to see maybe if it was a bunch of whales mating or feeding. Then things got more intense when a large silvery dome (looked like dome shape of turtle shell, curved) started to raise out of the rapids. Then hovered over the water for maybe a few seconds and vanished quicker then a blink of eye. The dome object was BIG MASSIVE. I thought it was a submarine then went it started to rise out of the water i thought it was some new government water vehicle submarine thing. But when it just vanished, i new that wasnt govenment. The water than calmed down fairly quick. Aside from that encounter, i have seen green flashes in the sky at night, and stars that seem to zip, stop and zip in different directions, sort of like bugs. But thats pretty much my story.
