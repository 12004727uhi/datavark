I have a sliding screen door in my bedroom and I usually look at the stars as I fall asleep. At least 2 times, maybe more, I've seen lights moving at high speeds extremely high up in the sky. Usually just white dots, and so high up they appear to be almost stars. These stars move in groups, sometimes splitting up and regrouping.",{"entities":[[86,94,"GPE"],[228,234,"TYPE"],[300,305,"COLOR"]]}],["First time it happened I figured I was sleep deprived but then it happened again while I was on the phone and I started watching and describing it as it happened. They're so damn high up that my phone simply won't record them, I'd need some kinda high zoom camera. The first time I saw them, it was a single light moving steadily in one direction across the sky, then suddenly sped off in a different direction. It settled over my house (again easily hundreds if not thousands of feet up) next to two other lights, they rotated around one another and then one by one sped off. Usually easiest way to see them is on a clear night, no clouds and watch for movement. These lights were not flashing or any colors, just white pinpoints of light moving erratically around the sky and one another. I'll try to find the specific dates.",{"entities":[[308,313,"TYPE"],[507,513,"TYPE"],[623,628,"TIME"],[670,676,"TYPE"],[715,720,"COLOR"],[734,739,"TYPE"]]}],["Ok one of these happened on July 25th early morning around 4 am, but that was the second time.
