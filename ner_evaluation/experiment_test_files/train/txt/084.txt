Sharing just for fun, I don't really have anything too substantive but a brief anecdote. I was in Banff national park, in beautiful Alberta, Canada for a bachelor party this weekend. When returning to our cabin around roughly 2 am, July 17, I happened to look up and saw a light in the sky traveling in a straight line similar to how a satellite would travel, even though for a satellite it seemed quite bright/low. It then began moving laterally/stopping as well as dimming out completely then lighting up again etc. which obviously ruled out it being a satellite. I pointed it out to one of my friends who also watched its movements with me and could corroborate what we saw. Admittedly I'm the weird "UFO" guy with the buds so they really could care less and were pretty casual about what I said we were seeing so we didn't stick around to see if it made any more or obvious strange movements like shooting off super fast or something. My buddy who observed the light with me agreed it was a little strange but was pretty quick to just dismiss it as a drone. I also think that it in all fairness its probably more likely that we were watching a drone in the sky than some craft from planet nebulon or something :P. I honestly know next to nothing about drones, but still, to me it seemed super high in the sky and Banff is kind of in the middle of nowhere in the Rocky Mountains for a drone to be ripping around at night. So for the record I'm going with alien spacecraft over drone just for shits and giggles
