Well I'm going to add mine here since I have no photo or footage. My office window looks at another building and clear bluebird sky with small clouds scattered about.

I was at my desk on the phone talking to my brother and I saw a white orb. Basically the brightest cleanest white possible. It entered my view and within a second entered the cloud going left to right. It was going fairly fast so, I wanted to see it exit the cloud. The end of the cloud was obscured by an air unit on the building across from my office window. When it didn't exit on the predicted straight line path, I stood up at my desk still on the phone and explained to him I saw an orb. As I was able to see it again it had turned back left and up and away vanishing in distant blue sky.

Of course being extremely curious I basically left my work and went out the back of the building to try and see it or make sense of it. So that's that and now I'm just watching out the window instead of doing my job. Atleast I'm the department manager.

Today 11-2-22 2:25pm central it would have been east- north east of Danville Arkansas.
