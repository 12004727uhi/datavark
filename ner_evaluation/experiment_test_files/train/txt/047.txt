Half circle trail with rainbow color bright dot. 
 
I was outside and saw this in the sky. It did not move. I called my friend to ask hi can he see it and he did. He is 200km away from me. Bright dot shined like rainbow. The trail was round and white. Strange thing is that it appered whole and disappered, trail and the dot. It did not move for about half an hour, after it vanished.
