Saw a pulsing/breathing light last night. Could have been the same object or several but it would slowly grow in intensity then dissolve. Must’ve happened 20 times in the same spot at random intervals, sometimes seconds would go by and other times minutes between the lights. Seen just out side Ridgecrest, CA about 00:30 8/13 directly North no more than 20° off the horizon. Had a friend further south that also says he saw the same thing at the same time. We were texting to confirm we were both seeing the same thing
