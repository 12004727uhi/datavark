Last week I saw a "star" in the Mediterranean sea sky not far from the coast of Sagunto, Spain. Today I came back to this town and it's still in the same area. The star is zig-zagging and making random moves constantly, like a fly. Its bright varies and seems to be always in the same area, not moving too far away. Tonight we could also see like something going out from that star, zipping and lighting and then suddenly vanishing, happened twice today.
