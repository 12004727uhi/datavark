October 18, 2023. 5:50 AM PST in Spokane, WA, near Argonne Road and Upriver intersection. Noticed two strange lights floating in the sky while I was driving to work. They gave off a warm white light that appeared to be a single light. As I got closer I realized that the single light was actually three different lights. I lost sight of one (because I was driving) and saw the other veer off slowly toward Downtown Spokane/North Spokane. Never thought I’d see a UFO but couldn’t identify it as a plane/helicopter. The only other explanation is drone but they seemed larger than any drone I’ve seen and didn’t have the silhouette of one either.

Anybody else in my area, or in the PNW, see something similar recently?
