I stand behind every word I’ve said about UAPs. They’ve been reported multiple times and it’s all been absolutely worthless to do so. I just want people to know that I’ve done my job at reporting what UAPs are doing here and it’s all been ignored.

Cognitive Abductions are possible from the sky and that’s most of what they do with devastating consequence to the population. All of it done covertly.

Most of what the “To the Stars” academy states about covert alien cognitive influence is correct but I completely disagree with the interdemsional theory as it’s actually done via these orbs which resemble “stars” and can hover for long periods “over the target”. Alien tech is a complete invasion of the human mind and body and it requires zero permission or foreknowledge from the victim, or as they state it, “the target” at all.

That’s why I know for a fact this is huge.
