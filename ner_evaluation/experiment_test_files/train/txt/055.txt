Chevron or triangle shape craft with bright orange light...awkward movements and disappeared 
 
Noticed a bright orange light in the sky that was slow moving...seemed to be Chevron or triangle shaped craft....made some awkward movements before disappearing then slightly reappeared....only to disappear again. Did not seem like a plane...and the light was bright
