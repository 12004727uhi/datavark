The object appeared to be significantly lower in altitude than a jet, and was going very fast - but slow enough for me to watch it travel in a straight line for maybe ten seconds. It didn’t make any noise. I believe it was traveling south to north, or at least heading north-ish. My sense of direction isn’t great, haha.",{"entities":[[99,103,"COLOR"],[105,114,"TYPE"],[298,316,"TIME"]]}]]}
