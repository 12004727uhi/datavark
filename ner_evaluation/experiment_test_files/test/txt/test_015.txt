July 9th, 10:35 PM, North of Rochester, MN.

Red light in the sky headed SE to NW. At first I thought it was a lantern with a candle in it but it was too high and moving too fast. Moving about the speed of a satellite. It would flare up every so often and as it moved farther north crossing the sky, it disappeared or flamed out. It resembled a rocket possibly? There was no debris trail or anything coming off of it and it wasn’t red like a light on a plane but more of a red flame color. I tried to take a picture but phone cameras just can’t do that well at night and it’s red blob.
