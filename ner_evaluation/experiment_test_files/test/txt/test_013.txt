UFO Experience September 11th-13th, 2021 Cococino National Forest Near the Grand Canyon…

I saw a UFO one night in the Cococino National Forest and I was this close to being abducted. I swear to god the only thing that saved me was my fear. I have never packed my car as fast as I did that night.

I was being stalked by a UFO. I was driving south on Route 66 and my cell service kept cutting in and out. I was talking to my aunt on the phone and it cut her off, so I stopped the car got out to take a leak, I was looking up and I saw the biggest star I've ever seen. It was cruising north. I yelled at the top of my lungs "I see you, mfers! Show yourselves!" And it stopped and uncloaked itself. It had a massive dome and a silver saucer.

I got back into my car and I called my aunt. Told her everything that I just witnessed and then I ended up camping off the highway in the forest.

Tried to camp anyway. I found a camp site with a giant teepee in the center. And I knew that was my spot. I unpacked my car and set up camp. I sprayed my deodorant along the perimeter of the campsite to scare away bears and wolves. Then I started a fire, it got dark really quick and the fire wood I had collected burned super fast.

As the fire was running low I was quickly trying to gather more. And I kept hearing branches cracking. Like there was something watching me. I yelled and screamed to scare whatever it was away. Then it got eerily quiet. That's when I saw a bright light in the distance and it lit up the forest from behind the trees. Kinda like in the movies. At that point I was scared for my life…

I started packing up my car as fast as could and I threw everything into the hatchback. I closed the door and I was shaking like a fuckin leaf. I started the car and I turned on my brights. As soon as I turned on my brights I saw a light being in between the trees. It sorta reflected the light but it was emitting light as well. I yelled and I said "The only way I am going with you is if you take me and my ship!”

After that I started doing donuts around the campsite. I think they left me alone after that. But I don't remember half of the trip after that so it's very possible that I was abducted… who TF knows.
