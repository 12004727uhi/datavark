Possible Ufo sighting rt 146 near north Smithfield RI

(July 1st) Headed to work at 9 am, crystal clear blue skies. Thought I saw a white passenger plane flying low with no contrails. After watching it for a minute I could tell there were no wings, it was just a white torpedo shape. Then it just disappeared without a trace anywhere on the horizon. That would be the second Iâ€™ve seen on that highway, with the previous one being a black rectangle thing.
