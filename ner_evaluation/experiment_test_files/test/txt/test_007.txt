This occured on Thursday, June 30th...about 10 miles east of Pittsburgh, PA. I was standing outside on my back porch looking up at the sky and seen a buzzard soaring above me, then out of nowhere, I noticed a dark gray (what I at first thought to be a bird) ufo appear out of nowhere. This thing did not have any lights, no sound and was moving at a fairly fast speed. I have never seen anything like this ever in my life. I didn't have my phone so I didn't get any footage or picture.
