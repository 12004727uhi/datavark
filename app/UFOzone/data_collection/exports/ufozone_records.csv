Had some weird lights coming back from Ohio to Indiana just outside of Fort Wayne. It was around 2:30 am Sunday morning on July 24. Before these weird lights started circling each other they had been darting back and forth and they are above the cloud line as well. I also looked for car dealership spotlights as it was on the highway and there were none to be found and the spotlights would not account for the darting back and forth.

I've come to share one thing and one thing only, after this I'm gone and that's it. I need to understand what this was and dig deeper, but after I have to move on. I have no pictures or videos but I DID TAKE VIDEOS AS IS HAPPENED, and since deleted them because it was over a year later and they weren't very good/totally freaked me out. 

So, it was probably summer the first time. A few years ago, I don't remember. I was still in highschool, so it must have been... 2017 or 2018. 

I remember the experience quite well, though. It was a clear night, the sky a lighter shade of navy, not jet black. The moon was to my left, I think it was about 4:00 or 5:00 judging on the position of the moon being well past midnight. There's a maple tree in front of the house, slightly to the right. 

I caught sight of a bright, bright light past the drawn curtains, and looking out the windows, I saw it. A ton of incredibly bright white light broken through the maple's leaves. I did think it was the moon at first. But the moon was on the other side of the sky. And this was brighter, and it didn't fome from one place, it seemed there were dozens of lights.

Through the tree, I also spotted those smooth, muscular patterns, like on muscle cars. Those wavy metalic ribs. The object also darted around at different speeds and angles, but was flat appearing in regaurds to how it moved: it only moved horizontally and not at all vertically.

At some point I also glimpsed a portion of it veering so far right that it was no longer hidden. The lights were dazzlingly bright and legitimately blinded me momentarily, however, I realized it was swiveling the lights around. It seemed to take the lights away in a different direction that I was, so it wasn't blinding me, and they were mostly pointed straight downwards.

It slowly veered out of sight behind the roof of the house and I wasn't brave enough to get outside to look at it. But before it slid away, I clearly, very very clearly, saw that it looked exactly as I thought. Dark, possibly straight black, with wavy metalic ribs (like on muscle cars) on the bottom, and as many as 50 huge, very ultra-bright, focused, swiveling lights. Each brighter than the moon and lighting up the neighbors house and the tree and the fence. It was as large as a football field and possibly 100, 150 feet high, considering the probably 50-75 foot tall trees surrounding the area. 

The second time was when I captured the videos, lost now. Everything was similar, about the same time of night, similar moon position, and the thing was behind the tree again. It seems to love to hide behind that tree lol. Broken light filtering through the tree, and the thing was there with the same shape and size and I could see some of the muscley-ribs on the underside of it. 

I took out my phone and recoreded a 10 minute video, poor quality, all you could see was a clear navy backdrop behind a tree with eerie light slipping through the branches. It slipped behind the house again and I gave up. After deciding it was 'safe,' I went to go sleep. But it was lingering on my mind and my heart was pounding. So I went back to the window, found it there, and recorded a second, slightly better quality 50-some second video, where you could catch a glimpse of the muscle on the object's underside for a brief moment. 

Both before and since, I've occasionally seen glimpses of eerie red or bright white light arranged in triangular formations very, very high in the sky above. They move swiftly and flatly (horizontally), and stay in formation throughout. They can be fast or slow. My brother convinced me they were satelites and I thought so for years, but I'm not so sure anymore. 

I also see plenty of choppers, annoying freaking choppers at night, usually well after midnight, usually during the warmer months or even spring. They are loud and circle the neighborhood, and I do have to admit ot my being in Northern Michigan where every 5 minutes there's another lake, and there's one in my neighborhood and the bay of Lake Michigan isn't too far, either. So it could be the coastgaurd, but I have an eerie and intangible suspicion that it's somehoe related to the UFO... I can't explain, but it seems too... specific. And too... coincidental. I also sometimes see these things and then that exact night, usually 20-40 minutes after, I'll hear the choppers and can often see them, and they're... so fast... for whatever reason the coastgaurd would be racing and tearing through my neighborhood at 2:00 am, 30 mins after seeing a very possible UFO sighting?? 

I don't usually go outside after dark. I bravened up once and did, but saw nothing, yet I was too scared to try again. I'd say every 2 or 3 weeks I see the 'satellites.' Several times weekly I see the 'coastgaurd.' And everytime I've seen the 'satellites,' the 'coastgaurd' always appeared shortly thereafter... 

So ahhhh... lol, am I safe??

Idk.

Oh and before leaving, genuine question: sometimes when I was a kid, I'd hear faint noises, like classical piano or standard radio or animal noises or ringing in my ears, but it seemed like it was faint, only ever at night, and it seemed... purposeful. Intentional. Everytime I experienced this, without any failure at all, no joke, I would see the 'satellites,' outside my bedroom window. Has anyone experinced THAT. Or an I actually just scitzophrenic?

Here's the thing: my therapist says I don't seem crazy. I'm just depressed right now, but that's itm she's checked me out and screened me for scitzophreniabefore, but told me I didn't seem delusional at all (about other things, monstly paranormal). Although get this: I'm Christian. Yeah, I don't believe in any of this stuff, I'm just so shaken that I don't really have a better idea right now, and for all the prayer in the world, I keep turning up blank. Sorry, God.

Saw what looked like a single spark of a firework with a trail, but was much too high in the sky to be any bottle rocket or firework. It was green with a trail of a few flashes. I first thought it was a shooting star, but it was much too low and I could see color. It happened so fast, but I saw it clearly enough to rule out fireworks, shooting stars, etc. My only guess is that it was space junk breaking up?
