I've come to share one thing and one thing only, after this I'm gone and that's it. I need to understand what this was and dig deeper, but after I have to move on. I have no pictures or videos but I DID TAKE VIDEOS AS IS HAPPENED, and since deleted them because it was over a year later and they weren't very good/totally freaked me out. 

So, it was probably summer the first time. A few years ago, I don't remember. I was still in highschool, so it must have been... 2017 or 2018. 

I remember the experience quite well, though. It was a clear night, the sky a lighter shade of navy, not jet black. The moon was to my left, I think it was about 4:00 or 5:00 judging on the position of the moon being well past midnight. There's a maple tree in front of the house, slightly to the right. 

I caught sight of a bright, bright light past the drawn curtains, and looking out the windows, I saw it. A ton of incredibly bright white light broken through the maple's leaves. I did think it was the moon at first. But the moon was on the other side of the sky. And this was brighter, and it didn't fome from one place, it seemed there were dozens of lights.

Through the tree, I also spotted those smooth, muscular patterns, like on muscle cars. Those wavy metalic ribs. The object also darted around at different speeds and angles, but was flat appearing in regaurds to how it moved: it only moved horizontally and not at all vertically.

At some point I also glimpsed a portion of it veering so far right that it was no longer hidden. The lights were dazzlingly bright and legitimately blinded me momentarily, however, I realized it was swiveling the lights around. It seemed to take the lights away in a different direction that I was, so it wasn't blinding me, and they were mostly pointed straight downwards.

It slowly veered out of sight behind the roof of the house and I wasn't brave enough to get outside to look at it. But before it slid away, I clearly, very very clearly, saw that it looked exactly as I thought. Dark, possibly straight black, with wavy metalic ribs (like on muscle cars) on the bottom, and as many as 50 huge, very ultra-bright, focused, swiveling lights. Each brighter than the moon and lighting up the neighbors house and the tree and the fence. It was as large as a football field and possibly 100, 150 feet high, considering the probably 50-75 foot tall trees surrounding the area. 

The second time was when I captured the videos, lost now. Everything was similar, about the same time of night, similar moon position, and the thing was behind the tree again. It seems to love to hide behind that tree lol. Broken light filtering through the tree, and the thing was there with the same shape and size and I could see some of the muscley-ribs on the underside of it. 

I took out my phone and recoreded a 10 minute video, poor quality, all you could see was a clear navy backdrop behind a tree with eerie light slipping through the branches. It slipped behind the house again and I gave up. After deciding it was 'safe,' I went to go sleep. But it was lingering on my mind and my heart was pounding. So I went back to the window, found it there, and recorded a second, slightly better quality 50-some second video, where you could catch a glimpse of the muscle on the object's underside for a brief moment. 

Both before and since, I've occasionally seen glimpses of eerie red or bright white light arranged in triangular formations very, very high in the sky above. They move swiftly and flatly (horizontally), and stay in formation throughout. They can be fast or slow. My brother convinced me they were satelites and I thought so for years, but I'm not so sure anymore. 

I also see plenty of choppers, annoying freaking choppers at night, usually well after midnight, usually during the warmer months or even spring. They are loud and circle the neighborhood, and I do have to admit ot my being in Northern Michigan where every 5 minutes there's another lake, and there's one in my neighborhood and the bay of Lake Michigan isn't too far, either. So it could be the coastgaurd, but I have an eerie and intangible suspicion that it's somehoe related to the UFO... I can't explain, but it seems too... specific. And too... coincidental. I also sometimes see these things and then that exact night, usually 20-40 minutes after, I'll hear the choppers and can often see them, and they're... so fast... for whatever reason the coastgaurd would be racing and tearing through my neighborhood at 2:00 am, 30 mins after seeing a very possible UFO sighting?? 

I don't usually go outside after dark. I bravened up once and did, but saw nothing, yet I was too scared to try again. I'd say every 2 or 3 weeks I see the 'satellites.' Several times weekly I see the 'coastgaurd.' And everytime I've seen the 'satellites,' the 'coastgaurd' always appeared shortly thereafter... 

So ahhhh... lol, am I safe??

Idk.

Oh and before leaving, genuine question: sometimes when I was a kid, I'd hear faint noises, like classical piano or standard radio or animal noises or ringing in my ears, but it seemed like it was faint, only ever at night, and it seemed... purposeful. Intentional. Everytime I experienced this, without any failure at all, no joke, I would see the 'satellites,' outside my bedroom window. Has anyone experinced THAT. Or an I actually just scitzophrenic?

Here's the thing: my therapist says I don't seem crazy. I'm just depressed right now, but that's itm she's checked me out and screened me for scitzophreniabefore, but told me I didn't seem delusional at all (about other things, monstly paranormal). Although get this: I'm Christian. Yeah, I don't believe in any of this stuff, I'm just so shaken that I don't really have a better idea right now, and for all the prayer in the world, I keep turning up blank. Sorry, God.

Possibly first spotted around 8:30am by my mom. I wasn't woken up until around 9:00am.  I was told a UFO was outside and the curtains were pulled open and I was told to look, and I spotted a dot in the sky.  I then looked at the object with the binoculars and would definitely say it was a black triangle object with yellow lights. I took my first picture of the object at 9:06am.  

In the binoculars the object was very clear but the phone and camera couldn't pick up the object very well.   
It was a black triangle with 5 lights in all.  But the lights would be in different patterns and sequences. e.g 1,2,3, and back to 1 light patten.  E.g. 3 lights in triangle. 4 lights in a square. The lights were yellow. .   
Around 9:20am, we moved into the garden to continue watching the object.
At about 9:27am we started spotting white dots flying around the object and moving very fast away.  I did catch one of these white dots moving away very fast on video at 9:42am. 
At about 9:35am when using the binoculars I did see a white dot appear from the object and fly towards the sun, where I then lost it.  

Overall the object was motionless for 10 mins in the sky, and then spent 30 mins moving away slowly.  Until and I do find it odd that we had 2 spotter planes flying around 9:45am and that's when this object then disappeared.  Coincidence, almost likely.

I am posting this here as I feel this is the right place to ask.

A couple of months ago I was outside at night playing basketball with some friends and as we were about to leave I had to take a leak and as I was, I look into the sky and see these series of small lights that from my perspective looked very far away. They were small white lights that would appear out of nowhere, travel for around 10 seconds at a pretty high speed and then disappear. In total there was around 20 of them from the time I looked up and they were equally spaced apart. They would all appear in the same spot and then disappear at another spot. I’m curious as to what these lights were and if anyone can provide any other details or information if they have either saw the same  thing, or if it is a particular space project that I am unfamiliar with.

Lac La Biche, Alberta 🇨🇦 
10-11pm Thursday, September 1st 2022

Tonight I witnessed a UAP that had unconventional flight paths. 

I noticed an abnormally bright light in the sky, it was stationary for over a minute until it started moving. The UAP started moving at a slow speed horizontally, then it took a 90 sharp turn. It had 2 bright lights at the nose of the craft. The UAP was flying at a slow rate of speed, it would make unconventional sharp turns. It had to be only 2-3000ft in altitude. The UAP flew a Grid like flight path, back and forth, then it would advance and fly back and forth, continuing this pattern for over 40 minutes. 

Here's the kicker! When the UAP flew over us, I noticed it had an audible sound almost like a piston fired aircraft, like a Cessna, but way quieter. A low and steady hum. When it would corner the RPMs were constant and the audible sound wouldn't differ as an aircraft would.

I'm very inclined about aircraft, their flight paths, engine tones, and maneuverability. This object wasn't an aircraft. I even searched on the FlightTrackerApp. There was nothing flying in my airspace except an airliner on a direct course. 

This UAP was almost mimicking the sound of a piston engine craft, but it made the most unnatural turns that were perfectly 90 degree corners. Fixed wing aircraft couldn't duplicate this movement. 

It wasn't a helicopter, and was too large to be a civilian drone. It was one of the most bizarre low flying UAPS I've ever seen. It was almost like it was scanning the ground below.

I'm curious if anyone's witnessed something along these lines, if so, comment your theory and experience below!",['LIGHT'],[],"[('LAC LA BICHE', {'longitude': -111.980096, 'latitude': 54.7681587}), ('ALBERTA', {'longitude': -115.002136, 'latitude': 55.001251})]","[datetime.date(2022, 9, 1)]","[datetime.time(0, 40)]"

San Diego. Approx. between Camp Pendleton and San Onofre. I was driving north on the 5 Freeway.

I’ve driven this route many times, day and night, and there are usually military aircraft flying around. The lights were traveling at a very low speed south east (so towards me). As I neared the lights, I could tell both of them were part of a single airborne craft. The craft itself was flying low somewhere between 300-700ft. I had to keep glancing back and forth between it and the road and as it got closer I could make out a faint shape, which was triangular and without a body—like a flying wing shape. The intense white lights were located at either end of the “wings”. At its closest to me it was almost directly above me and I had to hang my head out of the window (almost crashed) but at that moment I saw a smaller, rectangular blinking red light toward the back of the middle part of the craft. 

There is a part of me that thinks this might have been a military craft, given the proximity to the military bases, but I was so close to this thing and i am so certain of its shape.

Then it started swinging left and right while moving in it’s direction.. ok strange but not so much. Then it stopped. And didn’t move for the 15 mins I observed it. Another odd thing is that it stopped at a point where it made a triangle with another 2 bright objects.","['LIGHT', 'TRIANGLE']",[],[],[],[]

South Jersey, 25 minutes out from Atlantic City. Keeping the town redacted for my identity.

FAA will already have known about the object on their flight radar by now and are currently tracking it as we speak. Jets have also been being scrambled in my area all week over small civilian populated areas. I now know the reason why.

I close up at my job and I'm driving home after work. Not even 2 minutes on the road I see a bright white light, it looked like a spot light, hovering across the trees. I notice the trajectory means it's headed to the crossing of the intersection I'm headed towards. As I watch, a large black triangle craft comes hovering out from the trees and hovers over my car without making a sound. Stopped completely motionless and still, as if it was intent on crossing paths with me. I was driving and looking up the entire time trying to determine if its a plane or a drone. Which was dangerous, because I should have been watching the road. Have played many military simulators and aviation sims, this was no plane or drone. It hovered in place as I drove under it trying to process what I am looking at. I kept driving, but my brain instinctively told me to turn around and go back. I did. I drove back to make sure I wasn't imagining things, and I'm glad I did. The craft was still hovering in position. I watched it changed direction without acceleration, then go back in the direction it came from and slowly hover off into the woods and pine trees.","['LIGHT', 'TRIANGLE']","['WHITE', 'BLACK']","[('EST ', {'longitude': 25.3319078, 'latitude': 58.7523778}), ('SOUTH JERSEY', {'longitude': -74.8779305, 'latitude': 39.1065176}), ('ATLANTIC CITY ', {'longitude': -74.4229351, 'latitude': 39.3642852})]","[datetime.date(2022, 6, 29)]","[datetime.time(21, 20)]"
