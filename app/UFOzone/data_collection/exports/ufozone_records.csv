My husband and I were on the way home in Hialeah, FL at approximately midnight and all of a sudden we saw what looked like a comet at first. Bright light with a long red tail. He reminded me that we weren’t supposed to see a comet for another few days. Suddenly, the tail disappears and then the light after the tail. Light comes back with no tail and suddenly it looked like there was some sort of smoke forcefield around it that moved almost like a lava lamp. Then it turned into what I can only describe as a ball of fire with strings of light rotating in a circle under it. We’ve spent the past half hour trying to explain what we saw and the only stipulation we have against a UFO is that we were literally right next to the airport but it didn’t look like any sort of plane. All of the cars around us slowed down to a crawl because everyone was watching this thing, a few people even pulled over to record it. Has anyone seen anything that fit this description as well?","['LIGHT', 'ORB']",['RED'],"[('FL', {'longitude': -81.4639835, 'latitude': 27.7567667}), ('HIALEAH', {'longitude': -80.2781057, 'latitude': 25.8575963})]",[],"[datetime.time(0, 0)]"

However, this subreddit is full of dots in the sky, usually doing nothing, and that can be more plausibly explained by the mundane, as opposed to any extraterrestrial phenomenon: It makes us (anyone serious in this topic) look like fools. Unless that dot you’re looking at is defying physics as we know it, please for the love of god, disallow posts like the ones described from being posted here.

Thank you.",['LIGHT'],[],[],[],[]
