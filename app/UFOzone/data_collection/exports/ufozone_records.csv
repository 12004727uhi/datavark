If you zoom in on Google Earth on the Western side of Cyprus (35˚08 N 32˚39 E) you will see a shadow. It may look as the shadow of a mountain’s crest, but if you look closer, you can see it is not. The sun is too high on the sky for the mountain to cast this specific shadow, which look like a Stealth bomber. Also similar shadows would be seen on other northwalls in the area, but there are none. 
 
If it is a glitch in Google Earth cameras, then I expect these to be found elsewhere, but I have not been able to locate any. 
 
I think it may be the shadow of a craft - terrestrial or not - with advanced cloaking capability. If a Google airplane shot photos from above, the craft would not be seen - only its shadow.

Myers Lumber Co. 
 
 Not long after arriving I heard people talking loudly and with excitement just outside of the house. 
 
When I went to the door there were about 15 or 20 neighbors looking and pointing at something in the sky above the subdivision. 
 
I went onto the porch to investigate and sure enough there was some sort of craft hovering slowly high in the sky as if it was looking for something. 
 
I ran in the house to get my driving glasses and when I returned the craft was so low  I swear you wanted to reach up to try to touch it. It was huge and ominous looking. 
 
It was shaped like your everyday 'Flying Saucer' medium colored gray flat metal construction. 
 
As it continued to silently hover over our heads, a relatively small compartment slowly descended from the middle of bottom of the craft... there were lights in it but I couldn't see any occupants. Everyone was spellbound and silent. 
 
All of a sudden and without warning it disappeared in an instant....and immediately a military looking helecopter came swooping in so close & fast over our houses, we ducked in panic. The chopper circled the area quickly once and headed off toward the airforce base. 
 
Personally I'm not prone to believe in a future allien invasion...we have enough acting like that down here already, but I know what we all saw and quiet honestly I'm glad I am able to share the experience even though it has been about 50 years ago.

After the last craft went over I waited for any others then got my mail, went in the house turned the camera back on my iPhone and the video option was back available. About 15 minutes later I went outside and there were helicopters to my Northwestern sky.

A small white spherical object moved across the sky from NW to SE in a straight trajectory from horizon to horizon with seconds and was quite visible in the clear daytime sky.  A plane was flying far above in the sky at the time and appeared to be moving very slowly in comparison.  In comparison the plane appeared larger.  There was no sound and it left no trail.  I've never seen anything like it before and wondered if satellites can be seen during the daytime like that and if they move across the sky that quickly?  (Although it appeared to me to be closer to the Earth than the plane far above it, but maybe that was an illusion to my eye?)","['SPHERE', 'SPHERICAL']",['WHITE'],"[('MONTGOMERY, AL', {'longitude': -86.20285530376086, 'latitude': 32.36688727097397})]","[datetime.date(2020, 4, 12)]","[datetime.time(12, 0)]"

I was on a sailboat by myself travelling from Sturt Bay to the Powell River government dock in the morning.  At approxiamtely 11:00 hours while I was just off Grief Point I noticed two very bright lights about 500-800 feet above the pulp mill/dam.  I took my sunglasses off to try and focus, they were glimmering bright like the sun shining on stainless steel and appeared circular disk shaped with a raised portion in the middle maybe equalling about half the total diameter, I can only guess at this because the brightness was different in the middle. 
 
The objects were also large, probably over 50 feet in diameter and their distance apart appeared equal to their distance above the ground. 
 
As I observed, I also saw what I believed was a local Coast Guard (large red aircraft) surveillance rescue aircraft coming from the south hearing directly towards the craft at a slightly higher elevation.  It appeared to fly between the objects. 
 
As the aircraft came closed the objects didn't move, it appeared they faded, the glimmering became less and less to dim shapes and then nothing, just the blue sky and cloud behind.  It almost looked like they became cloaked with the background sky. 
 
Please note, the sun was behind me as I was travelling, possibly accounting for the glimmering on the craft, also I was not looking directly at or at and angle into the sun.  I don't know what I saw, but don't think it was a trick of my eyes and the sun. 
 
Trying to contact me might be difficult as I am up the coast on my boat, poor cell service and limited access to computers.  Who knows what it was…sun dogs??
