Seen out bedroom window on a full moon sky on the morning of October 10,2022 Off to the right of the moon was an object that had lights moving in circular fashion much like the icon when waiting for a program to load on computer. I took a picture from the bedroom window but felt the window screen was obstructing the image. I went out to our side yard to take a video. On video you can appreciate that the color of light alternated. I moved the video so you could appreciate the distance from the moon.","['LIGHT', 'CIRCLE']",[],"[('WYOMISSING  PA', {'longitude': -75.9652117, 'latitude': 40.329537})]","[datetime.date(2022, 10, 10)]","[datetime.time(4, 0)]"
