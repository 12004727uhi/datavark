NYC tonight, 9/10/22 at 1030pm

any thoughts on what this is- don't say building lights because it wasn't.
there was a bright orange light with similar-sized white lights (iridescent or like refracting light at times) that appeared in a pattern seen here - almost like a glyph. it seemed like the lights were moving, and the entire orientation of the general "structure," as my friend said, also seemed to change in unison slowly. foolishly, I did not take any videos.

We wondered if they were building lights, but there was no clear source to make such a pattern, plus they all slowly receded in unison further into the sky after many minutes of us staring until they were no longer visible (this was the strangest thing). we've wondered if they were auroras which is not likely in NYC. helicopters or other standard aircraft also seem unlikely because there was no noise.
we've come to the experts- what do you think or did anyone else see this in manhattan?
