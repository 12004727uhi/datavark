What type of plane has intermittent lights flashing quickly for 0.5 second followed by around 2 second of darkness?

So I was looking at the stars the other night and saw this moving object flashing in a weird way, and immediately thought it would be a plane.

The flash was something like 5 very quick flashes within half a second or so, almost looking like those firework explosions that explode in sequence, followed by a good 1.5 to 2 seconds of darkness. And then this semi random flashing again.

I decided it was a plane, based on memory (hadnâ€™t looked at the night sky since last summer) but about 10 minutes later I saw an actual plane and the image was very different.

Planes have 2 lights on the sides (each wing) plus a flashing red and a flashing green light.

So if this was a airline plane, what was the other one? Could it be an helicopter of some kind?
