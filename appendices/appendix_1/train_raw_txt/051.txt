Me and my daughter were driving to petsmart. We saw a flying object that was very large 
 
We were driving to petsmart to pick up my daughter from work. Two circles then seemed to be connected glided in front of us about eighty feet up. The circles were shaped like a sideways 8. They were outlined in a a bright green. Each of them were. With a red light in the middle. Then above them to the left of them was a tic-tac. They were all moving together. Just gliding along. No sound whatsoever. Went to the left side of my vehicle then they just disappeared. It was huge. We've never seen anything like it.
