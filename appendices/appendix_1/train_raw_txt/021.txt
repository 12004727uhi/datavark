Spotted a UFO traveling east on the south shore of Long Island along ocean parkway. The object in question appeared to have lights in the middle blinking occasionally and on the perimeter going off in sequential order around constantly but way more erratic than a plane or a helicopter , in person it appeared to be round and not a typical shape, speed wasnâ€™t extraordinary.
