Toledo, Ohio, 0145 am. Saw an aircraft with three distinct white lights in triangle formation that appeared to be stationary. Pulled over to record the aircraft/uap but noticed a blinking red light located center to the white lights, and decided against it. If it was a commercial aircraft it would have been both very large and very slow, which is normal upon approach, but it was not in line with any runway for Toledo. Even entering the traffic pattern it would have had a hell of a time. And it doesn’t make sense to enter a traffic pattern at that hour (at least to me)when there is no aircraft. I’ve flown into that airport before in a Cessna and just did a long approach. I rolled down the window and it did sound like the roar of an engine, but had no other lights beside the flashing red underneath and the 3 white lights. Another note is that the plane would have had to be flying right toward me to appear so stationary. It was concerning enough for me to want to pull over. But when it changed direction the formation of lights didn’t change. Nor did I see any additional wingtip lights. Probably a plane tho.
