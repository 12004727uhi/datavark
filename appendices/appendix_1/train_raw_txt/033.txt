so, a friend and i went to this field in a local park one night because i wanted to go look for ufos… she didn’t really believe in aliens or anything when we went. we were there for around 3 hours, around hour 2 (8:30pm) we see something across the field low to the ground, maybe 3 feet off the ground, hard to tell considering it was pretty far. we thought it was a person with a flashlight or something. well about 5 seconds later, it was about 20 feet further then it was before, which was odd. she was freaked out, and i was interested, so i wanted to go check it out. eventually she agreed and we went to check it out. we were walking for about 2 minutes across this dark field, and it wasn’t really moving, but suddenly, it quickly shifted directions. we were both a little freaked out, but very curious, so we kept walking. about 5 seconds later, it lifts off the ground more (maybe 5 feet off the ground) and starts BOLTING towards us. it was coming at a very fast speed and flying. we both looked at each other the moment it began moving and ran away super fast. after we got home and talked about it, she is fully convinced that it was a ufo (again, she didn’t believe in aliens until last night) we tried to come up with explanations, but there really isn’t one… and considering we both saw it, and both saw it flying towards us at the same time, means we weren’t just seeing things.
