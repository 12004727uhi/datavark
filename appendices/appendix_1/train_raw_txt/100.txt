A guy at my work today showed me on his phone a feed from one of his neighbors. It showed a video (or maybe picture) of massive groups of lights in the daytime sky. According to the guy, his neighbor took the video and says the giant clusters of lights were recorded in Santa Clara, CA. He said, his friend/neighbor said, the clusters where there for awhile, and then disappeared instantly.

Anybody aware of any talk about massive lights in the Santa Clara area sky recently?

I am going to ask him tomorrow if he can send me the video or picture from his neighbors feed; or how to navigate to it. If it looks legit, I will post it.

Shit, I just thought of something. Doesn't Paranormal Activity live in Santa Clara?
