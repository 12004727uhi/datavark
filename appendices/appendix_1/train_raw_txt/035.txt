Seen yesterday (Oct 28th) on I-76 eastbound out of Akron Ohio around 6:45. Never had a sighting or anything before and did not get picture/video.

I was on the highway around sundown and spotted a bright white light in the sky ahead of me. Seemed too bright to be a star, and I eventually noticed a blinking red light on it as well. Assumed it was an airplane only to realize it was hovering in place as I got closer. Thought maybe a drone/helicopter until I got close enough to notice it had the appearance of a boomerang and no visible propellers or fuselage.

Not convinced it wasn't just a helicopter/drone that I misidentified out of excitement. Wish I'd gotten a photo but I was too flabbergasted to even think about pulling over to do that, just kept telling myself it must have been a helicopter.

Anyone else see it?
