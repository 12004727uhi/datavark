A friend and I have spotted 3 times in the past week an incredibly bright object moving across the night sky, never on the same trajectory. Ive seen plenty of satellites and planes and this appearance larger and much much brighter than either. It emits an intense white light, no flashing lights and no sound. Once it simply vanished from view.

Last night it flew diectly overhead. After about 5-10 seconds, the white light went out and then the object became very small and emitted a solid red light and seemed to move away insanely fast and be gone from sight. 2 mores times it appeared within about an hour. Both times it went from super bright white and then down to small and dim.

Each time we've spotted it has been between 10-12 at night. We walk at night and how we've able to see this 6 times over 3 different days.

This has been the first time in my life that I've ever seen a flying object and had no idea what it was.
