12-1:30 am mid July this year my cousin and I were smokin outside her boyfriends house in Cheektowaga, clear sky we were on our second or third bowl wasn’t really fried yet I did have disposable on me n was chiefin it but still was that high and I was lookin at the stars talkin to my cousin on how one of these millions of stars prolly has life on it and and one person on that planet might be smokin thinking the same thing lookin at out planet idk not that important but while I was talkin about that looked at one of the stars and it was brighter than others, kinda looked like it was pulsating like brighter light than dimmer. I point at it kinda confused asking my cousin what she thinks it is and during that time is starts moving (and I stg on my momma on everything I love it wasn’t a plane or a helicopter) I freak out I’m like WTF IS THAT ITS MOVING WTF, I went inside a couple times cause I thought it was gonna take me away cause I noticed it but it didn’t and it kept disappearing sometimes and it moved like it people would describe a laser pointer on a wall like it could move any direction it wanted and yeah ofc I don’t got footage it was at night and I told my cousin to hang up the call and I tried using her phone but I was an iPhone there would be no way of yall seeing a tiny light floating in the dark sky. After I grabbed the phone and TRIED to record but failed all u got was hearing me react to the ufo and three other people disagreeing with including my cousin but later does agree, cause my cousins bf and friend came back from McDonald’s and they thought me and my cousin were crazy on everything than perfect timing it shows yo behind them In The sky I point to it and then my cousin and her friend both say it’s a plane but than I say no the way it’s a single light and it’s moving Like that can’t be a plane, they didn’t believe me ofc but while I was explaining that it stopped moving and disappeared. I didn’t hear a peep outta the dudes mouth who said it was an airplane the whole night, I think his brain didn’t want it to be a ufo so he tried to make sense of it. Idk if y’all believe me I’m just an 18 yr old stoner and ik wtf I saw idc if u don’t believe I really wouldn’t either, plus what are you gonna do if you believe me? Nothing will change Edit: July 23rd early 1:00
