I didn’t have my phone on me when I saw this last night. Between 9:20-9:30pm pst Saw a dark object with no flashing lights so I know it wasn’t a plane or helicopter. Moving from se to Nw you could see the outline of the object. Then to the north there was maybe 6-8 round lights moving fast in the direction of the dark object as the lights got closer to the object they would speed past each other and no longer be in a straight line then disappear.
