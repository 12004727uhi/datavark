I spotted a non blinking, bright, white light hovering over downtown Fall River while walking my dog. From my vantage point, it appeared to be around 200-300 feet in the air and moving back and forth from left to right rather slowly for about 20 seconds over a tree line about 2 miles away. It then sat in one spot for about 7 minutes before descending elevation below the tree line, thus losing sight of it. I approximate its location to be about a mile or two southeast of Battleship Cove right over downtown Fall River from my vantage point right on the border of Tiverton RI and Fall River MA.
