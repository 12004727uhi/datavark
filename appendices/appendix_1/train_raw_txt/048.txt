I saw a fireball swirling around in the sky like no craft can do. It split into two parts and came back together into one 
 
I saw a fireball swirling around and around for 20 seconds and then it dove straight down almost like a shooting star falling out of the sky. But then it disappeared once it shot down. 2 seconds later it re appeared and started swirling again. It shot over to the right near the woods and then disappeared behind the tree line. I saw it in the tree line one more time before it completely disappeared. It had a very long tail and it looked almost glittery. Definitely like a fireball. It looked unreal. I have never seen anything like this before in my life. My partner saw it near the end of it being in the sky because he has bad eye sight. But he saw it swirl around for like 10 seconds and disappear behind the tree line
