Watched a bright white light pass overhead. 
 
I was standing in my yard when I saw a white light coming in my direction. It was about as bright as Jupiter is in the sky tonight. I called my grandson to come out and see it. It was traveling along US Highway 82 from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery direction. I did not hear a sound from it.
