Could definitely just be an odd synchronicity

I was listening to a ufo/et podcast at work. I rarely look into the black helicopter phenomenon, and the podcast I picked had nothing mentioned in the description beforehand. The podcast had a dialogue about black helicopters/cattle mutilation and whether or not it was the government or the phenomena. 45 minutes later, a black black hawk flew into sight, going off towards the west. I’m over 100 miles from the nearest military installation, and Blackhawk sightings here during the day are very rare. First time I’ve seen one in 4 years living here.
