Sigh. Wednesday night I was outside playing with the nightvision camera on my doogee s98 pro, didn't realise you could lock focus and so was pointing up at the sky. Randomly I pan up and I caught something - a white dot shooting into frame from top, and then stopping dead. Problem is, I didn't realise it at the time (seeing tiny white dots on a smallish phone screen you're not even looking at because its over your head is quite hard) but you can definitely see it on a computer and its what made me pause. But ultimately, its a white dot the shoots in crazy fast and stops dead and then 1 second later I pan back away and I don't think you see it ever again. Doesn't seem like its worth sharing - I mean, bugs don't stop dead in mid air do they from a screaming speed?
