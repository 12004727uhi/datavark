Iowa.

Tonight I've saw a bright unblinking light silently travel half way across the sky before vanishing, and another bright unblinking light traverse the whole sky in 2 minutes on a sweeping half circle trajectory from the south to the north west before fading out.

Technically I've seen 5 total bright white lights traversing the sky tonight but 3 we're in straight lines and made no off normal flight path changes and are assumed to be planes?

2 nights ago the misses saw a light traversing the sky in a line before bolting in aute angles 4 times with a trail of light before zooming off at incredible speed.
