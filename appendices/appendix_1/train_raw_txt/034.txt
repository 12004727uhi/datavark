The husband and I have been getting strange vibes in our property the last few weeks, feels of being watched etc.

Today our neighbour across the way told us she saw a 2 red orbs right in front/ontop of our house. She only noticed because the light was so different from our motion light that she wanted to see what the red was. Saw the orbs and watched them for a while and went to check something. She went back and said they were gone. She wanted to ask us if we knew anything about the red light she saw. She said she didn’t wNt to sound crazy, we said we were UFO people and she felt relieved.

This was in maple ridge, BC, Canada. She said just a few days ago, she’s gonna report it to MUFON.
