Center Moriches, NY @745pm: just had a very strange UFO sighting. Was a series of white lights rising one after the other. Like one would fade into view, fade out of view, then the next would come. They followed a regular flight pattern and didn’t swerve in any way. Some of the lights were dimmed than others. Was extremely unique as it went on for about 30-45 seconds, maybe even a minute. I was just getting back from errands and was feeling lazy or else I would’ve ran inside to get my phone for a video. I also feel like phone cameras don’t capture the night sky easily so yeah… but I should’ve recorded it lol.

Now, I know what you’re thinking, but I have actually witnessed the Starlink satellites before once when I was in FL and this was very different. Instead of a ‘train’ of lights trailing eachother closely this was more like a pattern of individual lights, almost like they were attached to a giant rotating wheel or something.

I’m someone who loves the night sky/stars and I’m also always on the lookout for ufos. But I’m also very critical of any potential sightings bc most have a man-made explanation. But this one was really strange and I’ve never seen anything like it. Not sure if it was a UFO tho as the lights followed a regular pattern. Thoughts? Anyone seen anything similar?
