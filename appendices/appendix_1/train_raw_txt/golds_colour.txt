I saw 3 red lights with 1 white light in the middle.

The lights were orangey red.

The disk was silver and it was huge!

It was a black triangle, with three red lights at each corner and a white one in the center.

The cigar object was glowing green, like a sort of plasma.

There were three white lights with a dark object behind them.

There were 10 blue lights in the middle, with red, green and white lights around the edge.

The tic tac was glowing a purple blue colour.

The disk was silvery grey.

The orb was glowing an electric blue colour.
