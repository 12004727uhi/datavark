Saw a small dark round object in western sky 
 
Driving west from beachside Indiatlantic Fl we spotted a small dark round “dot” flying slowly in the western sky about 90*. 
As the object headed toward the clouds, it would occasionally sparkle and shine a silver/ rainbow color. 
We got over the bridge to the mainland it had gone in and out of the clouds changing from the round dark shape to a silver crescent shaped object that flashed and sparkled a few different light colors. We then lost sight of it in the clouds. 
This is the third time in a year we have seen similar round singular dark objects in this area… always around late afternoon
