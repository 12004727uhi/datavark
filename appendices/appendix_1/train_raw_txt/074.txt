I saw this exact thing in Fredericksburg, Virginia at 10:40pm - 10:50pm 7/28/22. I saw multiple "stars" dancing around the sky, I think I counted 7 in total. They seemed to ascend and approach me then dim and disappear almost like they flew behind a wall. They were white/orangeish color and the intensity varied.
