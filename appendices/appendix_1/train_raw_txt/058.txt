Black grey sphere in sky 
 
Large black grey sphere. Going from transparent to almost full grey black never moved. But almost seemed it was like waving like a flag. It continues slowly strobbing from transparent to full color till it completely faded away. By the time I though of grabbing my phone it totally disappeared.
