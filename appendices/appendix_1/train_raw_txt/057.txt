6 total fireballs one of them moving super fast shedding green cylinder light like space ship. 
 
We saw 5 close fireballs together and one was a little more distant, for a total of six. Thr more distant one started moving rapidly and changed color from an orange to green light. If showed a cylinder like shape. Kept moving super fast while the others separated. It lasted for a good 5 minutes.
