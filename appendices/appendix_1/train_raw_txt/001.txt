Garland, Texas. 10/11/2022. Approximately 3:30 pm. A friend and I decided to take a break from our work and went outside to stretch our legs.

After a few minutes of conversation, an object in the sky caught our attention. It was black and round. However, as it moved, its form slowly changed from round into something disc-like, which is how it remained for the rest of the sighting, which lasted about 30 seconds. Its color stayed black.

My friend and I estimated it to be about the size of a small car. We’re both reasonably skeptical, so it stood out to us that the object moved against the wind and made no sounds that we could hear.

Up until this point, I was still skeptical that it was anything out of the ordinary, but then it vanished before our eyes. It just disappeared.

Obviously this was very unusual and if it weren’t for my friend corroborating the encounter, I would’ve doubted my own senses.
