UAP mimicking piston engine aircraft

Lac La Biche, Alberta ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ 10-11pm Thursday, September 1st 2022

Tonight I witnessed a UAP that had unconventional flight paths.

I noticed an abnormally bright light in the sky, it was stationary for over a minute until it started moving. The UAP started moving at a slow speed horizontally, then it took a 90 sharp turn. It had 2 bright lights at the nose of the craft. The UAP was flying at a slow rate of speed, it would make unconventional sharp turns. It had to be only 2-3000ft in altitude. The UAP flew a Grid like flight path, back and forth, then it would advance and fly back and forth, continuing this pattern for over 40 minutes.

Here's the kicker! When the UAP flew over us, I noticed it had an audible sound almost like a piston fired aircraft, like a Cessna, but way quieter. A low and steady hum. When it would corner the RPMs were constant and the audible sound wouldn't differ as an aircraft would.

I'm very inclined about aircraft, their flight paths, engine tones, and maneuverability. This object wasn't an aircraft. I even searched on the FlightTrackerApp. There was nothing flying in my airspace except an airliner on a direct course.

This UAP was almost mimicking the sound of a piston engine craft, but it made the most unnatural turns that were perfectly 90 degree corners. Fixed wing aircraft couldn't duplicate this movement.

It wasn't a helicopter, and was too large to be a civilian drone. It was one of the most bizarre low flying UAPS I've ever seen. It was almost like it was scanning the ground below.

I'm curious if anyone's witnessed something along these lines, if so, comment your theory and experience below!
