Hey everybody! Had some weird lights coming back from Ohio to Indiana just outside of Fort Wayne. It was around 2:30 am Sunday morning on July 24. Before these weird lights started circling each other they had been darting back and forth and they are above the cloud line as well. I also looked for car dealership spotlights as it was on the highway and there were none to be found and the spotlights would not account for the darting back and forth. They also stayed within view for about 4-5 miles after initial sighting and that is with us driving 70 mph so we would have passed any dealership or spotlights daily quick. Only thing I can possibly think of is maybe two very high end drones. Please pick apart the videos and tell me what you all think! my 1st recording that I took with my own phone and seen with my own eyes

2nd recording my wife took
