I saw a really strange light anomaly last night (24/09/22) around 8:30pm in Southampton, England. I tried to video it but my phone camera can’t even pick up the stars let alone whatever this was.

It’s hard to describe so I hope you can picture it. I saw what I thought was a satellite going across the sky for a few seconds, it was moving a bit faster than a satellite though. It then suddenly disappeared, so I thought it must have been a ‘shooting star’, although it was moving quite slow for that. BUT THEN an identical light reappeared in the same spot that the previous one started it’s journey, did the exact same route, and disappeared at the same spot. This sort of repeat loop of this light continued for at least five minutes and I’m honestly dumbfounded as to what it could be.

I checked where the SpaceX satellites were last night and they were nowhere near the UK, and I don’t know of any other satellites that could even resemble that. I hope I described it well enough, but I’m happy to answer any questions and I’m open to theories, I really want to know what it was.
