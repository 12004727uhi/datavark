I'm an older fishermen who has fished the gulf of mexico for 25 years. A buddy of mine told me to come here and post a few stories. I have seen some strange things on the water, up close and personal. Water crafts that come right out of the water, making a whirlpool first and then zipping out. Waiting another week to post because this site wont let me it says I'm new and have to wait 14 days. No one really believes me, unless you were part of my crew. Something lives under the water.
