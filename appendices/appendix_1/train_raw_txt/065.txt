Comparison Video - Louisville, Ky - Left (airplane) 8/1 at 11:30pm | Right (??) 7/31 12:40am

It was hovering in place. Lots of colors seemed to be circling what appeared to be a diamond (best guess) shaped object from left to right (red, blue, white, etc). In the moment I couldn’t decide if the object was spinning or the lights were just circling the object giving it the appearance of spinning. It’s been stuck in my head for a few days so last night when I noticed a plane approaching I thought a comparison video might help debunk. The video on the left is repeating to make up for the length of the video on the right. It was there for at least 50 seconds.
