Was sunbathing in vegas at the virgin hotel on Tuesday at 16:25 watching the planes and clouds noticed this tiny white orb tried to show my girlfriend but she couldn’t see it so I took a bunch of photos it’s in the bottom right I’m shocked it actually shows up in the pics tbh https://i.imgur.com/4Ex9yDw.jpg https://i.imgur.com/dz6LiZq.jpg

Is there a way to embed the pics directly on Reddit? Pics are way higher res on my phone.
