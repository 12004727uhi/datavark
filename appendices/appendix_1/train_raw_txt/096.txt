Saw what looked like a black triangle rack for billiards floating through the sky during daylight hours. Didnâ€™t have my phone, watched it for ten seconds. It reminded me of that flat prison thing that Superman captured the evil kryptonian generals in, the way it was flipping around and rotating as it moved in a straight line in the sky.

It was a peculiar sky today too, with clouds moving in opposite directions and crossing through and around each other. Quite strange, a black triangle with a triangular hole in the middle flipping and rotating. Idk how big it was, my guess could be way off. It was pretty high. Bigger than a balloon, smaller than a plane.
