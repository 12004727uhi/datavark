I have no idea what I saw last night. I don't want to disclose my location, but I live in the Midwest.

Last night/this morning around 4 am I saw something floating in the sky. Being pitch black still, I have no idea how to tell how far away it was. I was in my back yard and have NEVER seen this thing before. It's not the flashing top of a tower or anything.

It was stick shaped, an almost perfect line up and down. It would alternate between flashing white, blue, and red lights. Mostly white, with occasional bursts of red and blue.

It hovered for the most part. Every once in awhile it would move slightly to the east or west. A few times it moved a little higher. But it always returned to it's centered position. I saw a plane begin to approach it at one point but couldn't say how close they were to each other. The plane was headed straight for it and then curved and headed north.

I've never in my almost 50 years seen anything like this. I've lived in my current location almost 7 years. I have bouts of insomnia, so I often sit outside on my deck late at night. Last night was something new that's for sure.
