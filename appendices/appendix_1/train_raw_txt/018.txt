9/19/22 around 9pm in Oklahoma City, was out with my mom when we spotted the outline of something flying at a high speed through the sky, but it was completely silent. Flying fairly low to the ground. It had TWO rows of lights, maybe 40 in total (definitely wasnâ€™t Starlink). We were able to follow it across the sky for maybe 20 seconds but it disappeared.
