July 4th Ocean City MD around 2:30 AM I saw two lights in the sky while on the beach. One vanished in the sky suddenly and the other one looked like it went down into the ocean. That was the first time I ever saw ANYTHING like that. After I recollected myself on what I saw ANOTHER came by that disappeared into the night sky as well. I'm at a loss for words. I'm a true believer now.
