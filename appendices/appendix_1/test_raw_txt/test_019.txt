Central Scotland 0430

On night duty but it’s light already. Me and my colleague both saw 2 objects race across the sky, lower than a plane and much much faster. One came then another a few seconds after. Going straight not up or down. Glowing orange and shaped like a cigar but with points at the end.

We thought they might be missiles and we only saw the tails but nothing landed and there’s been nothing in the news. But I searched online and couldn’t see anything that fitted exactly, trails seem to be a bit fluffy at the end but this was sharp at both ends.

If they weren’t missiles then they were definitely not of this world

Omg I just watched the video under this and it’s the SAME THING
