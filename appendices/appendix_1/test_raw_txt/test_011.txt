June 30th in Kansas I81 near Salina, time: 12:20-12:30, I’m driving down the interstate and a bright white light flashes incredibly bright in front of me, it looked ~1000ft in the air and looked like it was a flying object, as it flashes again it increases in altitude by another 200ft and produced a white light in the sky maybe ~100 ft across in a straight line facing what would be southeast or so, after driving back in the daytime I could confirm it definitely wasn’t a a cell tower, or a turbine, because it seemed to be way higher by a couple hundred feet.
