Upstate NY. 5/28, about 340am. 4 lights, straight line, equally spaced (if I moved my hand out to judge distance between objects, prob about 4 fingers apart from my perspective on the ground), moving at the same speed on a NE heading. Not flickering and no blinking lights.

I hopped on flightradar about 15 minutes after and only 3 planes in SW NY. Also checked the satellite tracker page and couldn't find any 4 that were traveling in that area in formation like that.

Are satellite's in orbit like that? 4 of them in formation? In the quick glance of the satellite tracker I could find 2 that seemed to be in formation.



It was pretty cool either way! (IDK if this is the right place to post this? I figured there would be more posts in here)
