Today in Destin, FL at around 11:50 local time. Witnessed two bright lights in the sky circling each other and phasing in and out. Looks like they were headed west. Then tgey were gone. A few moments later I saw two white orbs (not glowing ir bright white) traveling east above the beach. Just like what I see on here everyday. I wonder if the bright lights are tge uaps phasing in and then they become the orbs or tic-tacs or whatever.
