Just saw a long tube-like object fly over my house & appear to be fading in & out & disappear after going into a cloud. Could definitely be a small plane with the sun reflecting off it but I didnt see anything on the flight radar tracker flying in that direction. Only saw it for like 5 seconds so wasnt able to take a vid in time
