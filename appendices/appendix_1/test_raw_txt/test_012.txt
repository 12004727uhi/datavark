Hello, I am posting this here as I feel this is the right place to ask.

A couple of months ago I was outside at night playing basketball with some friends and as we were about to leave I had to take a leak and as I was, I look into the sky and see these series of small lights that from my perspective looked very far away. They were small white lights that would appear out of nowhere, travel for around 10 seconds at a pretty high speed and then disappear. In total there was around 20 of them from the time I looked up and they were equally spaced apart. They would all appear in the same spot and then disappear at another spot. Iâ€™m curious as to what these lights were and if anyone can provide any other details or information if they have either saw the same thing, or if it is a particular space project that I am unfamiliar with.

Thank you for reading.
