Anyone seen red/orange lights move side to side and irregularly? Twice now for me; dusk and dawn; one just now facing west over sylvan lake, MI and in the same spot at about 540 AM this last fall (?) maybe winter. I don't like posting vids right now because it's shite quality and mods need to get a better handle on these trolls. It's become a problem imo and these are seriously low level, easy to spot, bs-rs. Mods utilize your power; you can do it!
