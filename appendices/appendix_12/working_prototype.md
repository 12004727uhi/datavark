# Working prototype

The working prototype was available at: https://uap.datavark.uk

Note: The web subdomain ‘uap’ was used to signify that the DatavArk application would be suitable for use in other knowledge domains, given appropriate configuration and domain-specific model training. Since this prototype was developed for the UAP knowledge domain, as per the project scope, the ‘uap’ web subdomain was used to signify this.
