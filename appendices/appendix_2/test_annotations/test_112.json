They were small white lights that would appear out of nowhere, travel for around 10 seconds at a pretty high speed and then disappear. In total there was around 20 of them from the time I looked up and they were equally spaced apart. They would all appear in the same spot and then disappear at another spot. Iâ€™m curious as to what these lights were and if anyone can provide any other details or information if they have either saw the same thing, or if it is a particular space project that I am unfamiliar with.",{"entities":[[198,204,"TYPE"],[268,273,"COLOR"],[274,280,"TYPE"],[326,343,"TIME"],[590,596,"TYPE"]]}],["Thank you for reading.",{"entities":[]}]]}
