I was driving south on Route 66 and my cell service kept cutting in and out. I was talking to my aunt on the phone and it cut her off, so I stopped the car got out to take a leak, I was looking up and I saw the biggest star I've ever seen. It was cruising north. I yelled at the top of my lungs \"I see you, mfers! Show yourselves!\" And it stopped and uncloaked itself. It had a massive dome and a silver saucer.",{"entities":[[53,61,"LOC"],[249,253,"TYPE"],[416,420,"TYPE"],[427,433,"COLOR"],[434,440,"TYPE"]]}],["I got back into my car and I called my aunt.

And I kept hearing branches cracking. Like there was something watching me. I yelled and screamed to scare whatever it was away. Then it got eerily quiet. That's when I saw a bright light in the distance and it lit up the forest from behind the trees. Kinda like in the movies. At that point I was scared for my life…",{"entities":[[247,252,"TYPE"]]}],["I started packing up my car as fast as could and I threw everything into the hatchback. I closed the door and I was shaking like a fuckin leaf. I started the car and I turned on my brights. As soon as I turned on my brights I saw a light being in between the trees. It sorta reflected the light but it was emitting light as well. I yelled and I said \"The only way I am going with you is if you take me and my ship!”",{"entities":[[232,237,"TYPE"]]}],["After that I started doing donuts around the campsite. I think they left me alone after that. But I don't remember half of the trip after that so it's very possible that I was abducted… who TF knows.",{"entities":[]}]]}
