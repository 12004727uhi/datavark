Seemingly out of nowhere what looked like a giant envelope shape was silently gliding towards us. It was around low plane height. Say a small aircraft ceiling. Bigger jets were above it.",{"entities":[[199,207,"TYPE"]]}],["I really thought it was a big piece of debris from a construction site. Nothing made sense of that theory though. It wasn't windy enough and it was so high up. While watching it sort of flip and sort of wave or weave. Not out of control but more finding it's bearings. It was rectangle shaped. like an envelope. It leveled out for a few minutes before sort of bobbing up then drifting down like an airborne jellyfish. It was dark under and white or silver on other sides or side. It seemed three dimensional but i could see just the shape. It went into some cumulo nimbus clouds and i could still make it out. It went on bobbing and drifting until i couldn't see it anymore.",{"entities":[[276,285,"TYPE"],[302,311,"TYPE"],[331,344,"TIME"],[425,429,"COLOR"],[440,445,"COLOR"],[449,455,"COLOR"]]}]]}
