This thing, which I remember as about the size of a spare tire, metallic like, with lights flashing all around it, flew in front of us, about 50 feet above the ground. It made a buzzing, vibrating sound, then it flew off near a wooded area and disappeared. The encounter lasted about 10 seconds. I remember it vividly, like it happened yesterday. The strange thing is that me and my cousin never talked about it. Lately I've been thinking about it often.",{"entities":[[49,56,"GPE"],[162,168,"TYPE"],[356,373,"TIME"]]}]]}
