Saw satellites moving across the sky as usual, but then saw a “star” moving back and forth in a small section of sky. It wasn’t moving across the sky like a satellite, and wasn’t stationary like a star or planet. It was moving back and forth in a small section of sky like it was bouncing between two points. I watched it for a long time to confirm I wasn’t just seeing things. My girlfriend saw it as well and confirmed that it was just a point of light in the sky that wasn’t following any flight patterns or orbit. Was literally just bouncing back and fourth. It was literally moving in a back and forth motion, based on fixed stars behind it in contrast to its movement. What was this thing?",{"entities":[[7,13,"GPE"],[14,21,"GPE"],[124,130,"TYPE"],[511,516,"TYPE"]]}]]}
