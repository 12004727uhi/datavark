I saw a “Tic Tac” once for a couple seconds, just slowly moving across the sky, and then it faded out and disappeared as it was moving. I’m pretty sure the sky was clear. Definitely didn’t vanish behind a cloud- it faded out like it was engaging a cloaking device or something lol. Is this a thing that happens? I’m guessing the “Tic Tac” was just an airplane at an odd angle (which I interpreted as a Tic Tac in the two or three seconds I saw it for because I had UFOs on the mind around that point in time- it was right near the release of the UFO report last year) and that its disappearance was just an optical illusion of some sort, but I’d like to know if that’s a known type of illusion. Or is there anywhere else I should ask?",{"entities":[[88,92,"COLOR"],[106,115,"TYPE"],[125,141,"TIME"],[427,436,"TYPE"],[500,507,"TYPE"],[515,535,"TIME"]]}]]}
