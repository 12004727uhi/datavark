I went out front of my house just to get some fresh air and spotted a very long & slow moving Cigar shaped, or as I explained to my wife, looked like a floating fluorescent light bulb. Coincidentally, there was a jet airliner on it's way to JAX and it appeared to be about 8-10 miles west of the object. The Jet Airliner appeared to be approx 1/10 the size of the object. Speed was very slow, I have seen falling stars and this was not one of them. I was able to watch this thing for about 15 seconds, then it disappeared. My first incredible sighting.....WOW!",{"entities":[[0,9,"DATE"],[11,18,"TIME"],[63,72,"GPE"],[74,82,"GPE"],[177,182,"TYPE"],[567,583,"TIME"]]}]]}
