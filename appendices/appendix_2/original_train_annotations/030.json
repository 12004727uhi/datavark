The UAP started moving at a slow speed horizontally, then it took a 90 sharp turn. It had 2 bright lights at the nose of the craft. The UAP was flying at a slow rate of speed, it would make unconventional sharp turns. It had to be only 2-3000ft in altitude. The UAP flew a Grid like flight path, back and forth, then it would advance and fly back and forth, continuing this pattern for over 40 minutes.",{"entities":[[31,36,"TYPE"],[71,84,"TIME"],[209,215,"TYPE"],[496,511,"TIME"]]}],["Here's the kicker! When the UAP flew over us, I noticed it had an audible sound almost like a piston fired aircraft, like a Cessna, but way quieter. A low and steady hum. When it would corner the RPMs were constant and the audible sound wouldn't differ as an aircraft would.",{"entities":[]}],["I'm very inclined about aircraft, their flight paths, engine tones, and maneuverability. This object wasn't an aircraft. I even searched on the FlightTrackerApp. There was nothing flying in my airspace except an airliner on a direct course.",{"entities":[]}],["This UAP was almost mimicking the sound of a piston engine craft, but it made the most unnatural turns that were perfectly 90 degree corners. Fixed wing aircraft couldn't duplicate this movement.",{"entities":[]}],["It wasn't a helicopter, and was too large to be a civilian drone. It was one of the most bizarre low flying UAPS I've ever seen.
