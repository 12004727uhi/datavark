Both objects had a bluish light, that somewhat resembled a web. The lights coming off the objects were coming from underneath them, pointing toward the ground in a long triangular shape. The light was wider at the base of the objects and thinning out closer to ground. Above and behind the objects there were two other aircrafts. One, a helicopter with the typical blinking red, blue, and solid white lights. The other aircraft easily identified as a commercial plane. The two objects being reported were not blinking. Solid bluish/white light. They also flew in an unusual speed. Slow, smooth. Then gradually faster. Also the their altitude changes were incredibly graceful. The object in front of the other would rise and the second one dipped low and then, again, made a subtle and graceful move up to meet the first objects altitude. They were headed toward a high tree line which would block my sight of them. I quickly moved toward the other side of the trees, 5 seconds at most. I stood exactly where they were headed. But that quickly they disappeared. However the helicopter and plane were still in sight. Two other witness saw the same thing I described.
