Location: northern Italy, looking West towards Alps (specifically Monte Rosa). I was enjoying a nice sunset when i noticed 3 orb-shaped objects \"floating\" in air, in the distance. They stayed still. 2 of them were really close, and bright, while another one was kinda traslucent, on the top of the formation. I took a pic. But what really made me wonder is what happened next. I kept on observing, and I noticed a very bright line in the sky. I assumed it was a normal trail created by an airplane, with a high albedo for some reason. Until the trail splitted in two. One part, the nearest to my perspective, stayed almost still. It looked like the plane stopped suddenly to emit trail, which I know happens... But then the \"rear\" part of the line started to move in the opposite direction doing an almost perfect circular shape. It took a while and the brightness of both lines was always the same. I honestly don't know what to think, so I'm asking you guys if this description fits any kind of natural phenomenon or known military exercises, I don't know really. Thank you and please pardon my english, I hope this post is understandable enough :)",{"entities":[[78,87,"TIME"],[105,119,"GPE"],[142,146,"LOC"],[161,171,"LOC"],[220,230,"TYPE"],[363,373,"COLOR"]]}]]}
