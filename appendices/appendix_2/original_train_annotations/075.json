At first it was bright white then It faded out to a reddish Color then a few seconds later faded to a blue and went dark.. it didn’t break any laws of physics or anything from where I was looking but didn’t act like any plane helicopter I’ve ever seen.. right after it went dark a couple of shooting stars flew past . I’ve seen some people talk about looking up what planes were flying overhead at an exact time, is that an app or something?",{"entities":[[37,44,"TIME"],[48,55,"GPE"],[56,58,"GPE"],[135,153,"TIME"],[177,182,"COLOR"],[206,213,"COLOR"],[225,238,"TIME"],[256,260,"COLOR"],[270,276,"COLOR"],[428,432,"COLOR"]]}]]}
