Not even 2 minutes on the road I see a bright white light, it looked like a spot light, hovering across the trees. I notice the trajectory means it's headed to the crossing of the intersection I'm headed towards. As I watch, a large black triangle craft comes hovering out from the trees and hovers over my car without making a sound. Stopped completely motionless and still, as if it was intent on crossing paths with me. I was driving and looking up the entire time trying to determine if its a plane or a drone. Which was dangerous, because I should have been watching the road. Have played many military simulators and aviation sims, this was no plane or drone. It hovered in place as I drove under it trying to process what I am looking at. I kept driving, but my brain instinctively told me to turn around and go back. I did. I drove back to make sure I wasn't imagining things, and I'm glad I did. The craft was still hovering in position. I watched it changed direction without acceleration, then go back in the direction it came from and slowly hover off into the woods and pine trees.",{"entities":[[63,72,"TIME"],[100,105,"COLOR"],[106,111,"TYPE"],[135,140,"TYPE"],[287,292,"COLOR"],[293,301,"TYPE"]]}]]}
