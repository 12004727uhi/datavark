About a second or so later this fucking thing just went into like hyper speed or some shit and had like a red trail of something behind it, almost like the hyper speed shit in Star Wars and after a second it literally vanished into thin air. Poof. I’m not someone who really believes in conspiracy theories per say but this happened about 20 minutes ago and I’m kind of freaked the fuck out. Can anyone suggest what that may have been I’ve never seen an aircraft literally going into hyper speed and fucking vanish within a second like it was moving slowly and just went VOOOOM. Poof gone. It was far away so it’s not like it just left my field of view I would have still been able to see it I’m so weirded out. Please let me know what you guys think and suggest wtf I just saw I’m posting it here because maybe someone’s seen something similar.",{"entities":[[42,50,"TIME"],[254,268,"TIME"],[360,363,"COLOR"],[587,607,"TIME"],[769,784,"TIME"]]}]]}
