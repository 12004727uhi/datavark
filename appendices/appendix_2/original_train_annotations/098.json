Anyone? \"Reading about UAPS lately and it's got me thinking about a thing I saw back in the day. I haven't been able to explain it away but it doesn't mean one of you can't. I was travelling with my family heading somewhere along the Newell Hwy in outback NSW, Australia. Clear blue skies. I am in the back of the camry with my siblings and mum & dad are in the front. I look out the window & notice a ball of fire in the sky(not the sun). It looks like it's flying along and I can't tell if it's very far away travelling very fast or if it's a lot closer travelling very slow. It looked like it had a tail of fire like you might imagine on a meteor except very short. I alert everyone in the car and their reactions blow me away. They look at it and dismiss it as nothing. Dad says meteor or falling satellite, makes a joke that the Russians have launched a nuke at the next town, mum suggests it could be 'some sort of gas'. No-one is even curious. The thing seems to stay in the sky for the longest time(maybe an hour) not really moving relative to our car until the road bends and takes us away from it. I remember cranking my neck watching it as slowly get smaller & smaller as we drove away until I couldn't see it anymore. I dismissed the falling satellite/meteor because it was in the air such a long time. Does anyone have any ideas? Could this have been some kind of meteor? Thanks.\"",{"entities":[[276,286,"GPE"],[298,301,"GPE"],[303,313,"GPE"],[320,324,"COLOR"],[444,456,"TYPE"],[1049,1062,"TIME"]]}]]}
