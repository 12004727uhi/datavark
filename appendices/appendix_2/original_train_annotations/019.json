They were just sitting there still, not moving in any direction, and by the time I pulled out my phone to try and get a picture, they were gone. I was baffled at what I saw, I just don’t know how it could be planes or anything because of how long it was and how still it was. I don’t know how else to explain it but it was high in the sky, long and bright, then it was just gone.",{"entities":[[0,5,"DATE"],[7,27,"DATE"],[28,47,"TIME"],[134,139,"COLOR"],[140,146,"TYPE"],[152,162,"GPE"],[163,169,"GPE"]]}]]}
