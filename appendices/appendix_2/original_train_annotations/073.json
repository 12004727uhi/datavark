I saw what looked like a star, one of the brighter ones, but it was moving from right to left in the sky (I can try to determine actual direction if needed) and as I watched it move, there was no sound ever and it stopped for a second, then 4 bright lines appeared, making an X with a bright dot in the middle, and before I could really comprehend that, it started fading and shrinking, like it was zooming straight into space and after about a second or two it was completely gone. This was my first ever encounter of something like this and it freaked me tf out. Needed to reach out to a community or someone.
