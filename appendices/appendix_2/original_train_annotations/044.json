I thought, that's strange and kept looking at it thinking maybe it was lit up smoke trails from a plane or something. Then i realized it was coming closer and the line of light never disappeared or got elongated like smoke does. It was all moving TOGETHER! A couple other customers saw me and wondered what was up and i pointed it out to them. They were stunned too. Then it was immediately overhead. You could see each individual light on the bottom of the thing! The rest of it was just enough into the cloud cover so you couldnt see it. It was 100% quiet. It was HUGE! And it was relatively fast.",{"entities":[[98,103,"TYPE"],[300,305,"TYPE"],[560,565,"TYPE"]]}],["The pic i took is over exposed from all the parking lot lights. A couple of people tried to pass it off as a satellite. No. It was waaay too close for that! Each individual.
