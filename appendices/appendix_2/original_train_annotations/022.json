Saw an odd point light in the sky that had a comet like appearance (bright with a tail). I watched vaguely intrigued for couple of seconds and the tail disappeared. It was traveling steadily across the sky (similar to a plane not like satellite). The point light seemed to gradually fade in intensity which I at first attributed to passing behind the spotted clouds. I only stared at it a few moments more and realize the clouds had nothing to do with the variation in it’s brightness. It reached the far side of the of the sky(approx 120 degrees from where I started observing and grew in intensity so it was a very bright point light and no doubt not related to the cloud cover. At that moment it began to steadily decrease in intensity, fading out to nothing and disappearing over several seconds. Immediately after disappearing, three unique helicopters (I think) - very military like - appeared in the area, brightly lit with a triangular lighting pattern. They briefly encircled the general area the light had occupied and then left. This was the first time I’ve ever noticed something so odd in the sky. Have no explanation, brief experience, not particularly spectacular, but I cannot stop thinking about it. Another women at the concert next to me stopped me later and said that she saw the same thing and was also amazed (so not just me and my boyfriend).",{"entities":[[9,16,"GPE"],[61,66,"TYPE"],[165,182,"TIME"],[301,306,"TYPE"],[431,444,"TIME"],[674,679,"TYPE"],[828,844,"TIME"],[977,987,"TYPE"],[1050,1055,"TYPE"]]}]]}
