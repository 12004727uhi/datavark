Was chilling outside with my SO, just talking, when out of no where he says, “do you see that?? what’s that???”. I turn around and face his direction and look towards at the sky. To my surprise I spot it pretty quick! (i can be slow😐) I see a disc looking object but tilted to its side, the bottom facing me. Crazy thing is that it was camouflaging itself with the sky! That’s when I knew wtf it was that I just saw. As the ship was traveling at a fast rate, I could see the object.. more so it’s bottom. it didn’t have a specific color or big lights, it was just camouflaged with the sky. I could see the color of the night sky n little “stars” on it. it was traveling fast heading east, in a zig zag motion for just a little bit than straight and just disappears. The object was pretty far for me, but I could clearly see it. I had my glasses on and eyes peeled to its every single move.",{"entities":[[0,21,"DATE"],[22,37,"TIME"],[38,43,"GPE"],[45,48,"GPE"],[293,297,"TYPE"],[669,674,"TIME"]]}]]}
