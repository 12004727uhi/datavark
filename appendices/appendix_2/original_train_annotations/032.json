Noticed two strange lights floating in the sky while I was driving to work. They gave off a warm white light that appeared to be a single light. As I got closer I realized that the single light was actually three different lights. I lost sight of one (because I was driving) and saw the other veer off slowly toward Downtown Spokane/North Spokane. Never thought I’d see a UFO but couldn’t identify it as a plane/helicopter. The only other explanation is drone but they seemed larger than any drone I’ve seen and didn’t have the silhouette of one either.",{"entities":[[0,17,"DATE"],[18,29,"TIME"],[33,40,"GPE"],[42,44,"GPE"],[51,63,"GPE"],[68,89,"GPE"],[110,116,"TYPE"],[187,192,"COLOR"],[193,198,"TYPE"],[228,234,"TYPE"],[278,283,"TYPE"],[313,320,"TYPE"],[406,437,"GPE"]]}],["Anybody else in my area, or in the PNW, see something similar recently?",{"entities":[[35,38,"LOC"]]}]]}
