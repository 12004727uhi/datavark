It then suddenly disappeared, so I thought it must have been a ‘shooting star’, although it was moving quite slow for that. BUT THEN an identical light reappeared in the same spot that the previous one started it’s journey, did the exact same route, and disappeared at the same spot. This sort of repeat loop of this light continued for at least five minutes and I’m honestly dumbfounded as to what it could be.",{"entities":[[114,127,"TIME"],[327,332,"TYPE"],[498,503,"TYPE"],[518,539,"TIME"]]}],["I checked where the SpaceX satellites were last night and they were nowhere near the UK, and I don’t know of any other satellites that could even resemble that.
