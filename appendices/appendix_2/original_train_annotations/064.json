Very rapid movement between Sleeping Bear Point and South Manitou Island. The ufo made vertical movements, to the point where it appeared to almost touch Lake Michigan, hovered in place and moved rapidly north and south on a couple of occasions before going out of sight. Anyone else catch this? Post sighting we heard a helicopter and a jet. Two very unusual things to hear in this area. The Canadian freighter Michipicoten was in the vicinity at the time too as well as a sailboat named Utah. If anyone has connections to these vessels people on board may have experienced the sighting as well. Saw it with my sister and all in all it was approximately a 3 to 5 minute event. Tried to get video but it was too far off.",{"entities":[[22,37,"GPE"],[41,51,"DATE"],[52,67,"TIME"],[96,115,"GPE"],[120,141,"GPE"],[222,235,"LOC"],[725,738,"TIME"]]}]]}
