Text: I've never seen a UFO before in my life but tonight I saw THREE in rapid succession. They were very small, each had a blinking light (the first two yellowish, I saw them at the same time and they seemed to be interacting, the third I saw alone about a minute later and had a red light). Was too dark for me to even make out much of a shape since they were very small (or maybe the body minus the lights was invisible or cloaked?)
 
They moved too quickly to be drones. Plus it's past midnight and I've never seen anyone flying drones around here.  Obviously weren't lights from a plane since at their lowest they were like 5 ft from the ground. I can't think of anything else they could possibly be! They each disappeared after a few seconds as well, or at least the lights were no longer on. 

Location is the far south side of chicago! Anyone else see them? I know it's a long shot, it's late and it's cold. I was only outside to smoke some weed but I saw them before I even had time to light up.

Text: Sighting: Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 6:45 PM, December 27, 2022. I feel so so so dumb I didn’t take my cellphone outside with me. EDIT: some spelling and grammar mistakes 

My partner was outside my house smoking and poked his head in. He asked what planets we could see from the house, and I told him, and he was like: “are any of them bright green?” Dumbfounded, I went outside and looked up where he indicated, in the western sky behind my house. Whatever he had seen was gone and he was like “it was right there.” It was a cloudy night with patches of clear sky. The clouds were moving pretty quickly, and revealed a big green star in the sky. Except it moved. I said: “I don’t think that’s a star”. A minute later it jumped altitude - I don’t know how high, I know nothing about altitudes aside from typical meteorological cloud heights - but one minute it was in one spot in the sky and the next it was way higher. I got excited and tapped him on the shoulder to look, but it blinked out of sight. I scanned the sky to see if it would come back. Out front of the house, to the southeast, more clouds cleared and I watched a big blue/whitish light moving at plane height. “I think that’s a plane,” I said to him. Almost as soon as I said that, it stopped dead, changed shape slightly from a ball-like/light shape to something elongated, back into a circle shape, and began to fly in a circle, vertically. I hope that makes sense - I mean in a circle vertically/counterclockwise I could see looking at it dead on not in a round/searching circle horizontally like a helicopter. Clouds covered it. I scanned the sky again - it appeared in the first location I’d seen it but further away, and traveled almost an identical path. It stopped dead again and hovered, reversed, then flew in a zig zag pattern. 

The cloud cover grew too thick and though I stayed out a little longer I didn’t see anything else. I was excited and whispering like “Hi! Come back!” very excitedly because I’d never seen anything like it before, and behind me my boyfriend was becoming more and more frightened/agitated and he actually dragged me back into the house. 
When we came back inside my boyfriend immediately threw up in the bathroom. My heart was beating like I’d just ran a marathon and I was elated. But within an hour I developed a terrible headache that I still have two hours after seeing the object. It has not gone away and I still feel a little nauseous.

Before anyone asks, yes I’ve checked my carbon monoxide levels - we have new batteries in the detector and I tested it a week ago so it’s still working. We did not consume any hallucinogens, and he was smoking a non nicotine (non THC!) cigarette. (He’s trying to quit). I had no alcohol, had just drank water actually, and we had not eaten any of the same things that day yet - I work from home, he works outside of the home, and I hadn’t finished making dinner when this occurred. 

I will freely admit I have been looking into methods to try and make contact/communicate with non-human entities - even way far out methods that I wasn’t sure I believed, so I guess something I tried worked?? Only way to know for sure is to try again, so I will attempt the same method again - on a night I’m not feeling sick. I’m pretty stoked about it still even though I feel ill. My boyfriend was completely freaked and I’m kind of sad because I only got good vibes from the whole experience. I think it would be incredible to make contact with something outside of our normal way of life. 


TLDR: saw one or two very strange crafts outside tonight that did some very non-typical non-aircraft-like things. Not drunk or high or poisoned by carbon monoxide. I still feel sick after witnessing.

Text: Would love some input on what I saw. Looking at the sky, southward in Miami, saw what looked like a drone without lights flying high above buildings. I’m in a flight path for MIA and at first through it was a plane without its lights on. Then it swerved back. The central v shape was very dynamic and dark but it was surrounded by fair tiny lights, did a loop and went out of sight. It looked almost bird like followed/surrounded by a mesh of fireflies.

Text: It was about 4:30 p.m. I was driving north on Kedzie in Blue Island, ILLINOIS. I looked in the sky and seen what I figured was a hot air balloon or blimp of sorts, but it seemed made out of metal.

It was flying low and slow.  Maybe 30 stories up. I wish to God I would've just pulled over and shot a video of it. It was huge, long and shaped somewhat like a formula 1 race car, meaning that it had these compartments that protruded outwardly. 

It was just too surreal and I brushed it off as I figured "there's no way this it what I think it is"".... Looking back

I was on the beach in Cape Canaveral for the launch of the Falcon Heavy on Tuesday 11/1. With my naked eye I saw a stationary dark orb in the sky (pic taken at 9:48 a.m.) It was not a bird, plane or helicopter. iPhones take terrible photos from a distance. The first photo is the original, the second is a zoomed-in version so the dark orb can be seen. Obviously you can take the original and zoom in yourself... the orb is just above the clouds which are slightly below and to the right of the sun. (I am NOT referring to the blue dot lower right which is some kind of reflection of the sun on my camera lens) It was especially interesting that it happened during a rocket launch.  I'm thrilled to finally see one for myself.

It fell about 1/5 of the sky in maybe 30 seconds so it was moving very fast. Anyone have an idea on what this could be? I guessed a plane crash but don’t really have a close

Text: I saw something about 3 nights ago. I was out walking my dog in a grass field right by the Nampa, ID school district office building. I was listening to some music while we walked as is our normal routine. Where I live though puts me pretty squarely in town so I don't have the greatest view of the sky at times with light pollution. That night though there was a very red light I didn't recognize as one of the stars I normally do see. It was solid red, unblinking. I've seen helicopters at night before and I know planes lights blink but this was not that at all. It moved from my perspective slowly about 2 feet across the sky before it finally went so far away that I could no longer see it.

Text: Well I'm going to add mine here since I have no photo or footage.  My office window looks at another building and clear bluebird sky with small clouds scattered about. 

I was at my desk on the phone talking to my brother and I saw a white orb. Basically the brightest cleanest white possible. It entered my view and  within a second entered the cloud going left to right. It was going fairly fast so, I wanted to see it exit the cloud. The end of the cloud was obscured by an air unit on the building across from my office window.  When it didn't exit on the predicted straight line path, I stood up at my desk still on the phone and explained to him I saw an orb. As I was able to see it again it had turned back left and up and away vanishing in distant blue sky. 

Of course being extremely curious I basically left my work and went out the back of the building to try and see it or make sense of it.  So that's that and now I'm just watching out the window instead of doing my job. Atleast I'm the department manager.
