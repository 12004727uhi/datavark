Text: I've never seen a UFO before in my life but tonight I saw THREE in rapid succession. They were very small, each had a blinking light (the first two yellowish, I saw them at the same time and they seemed to be interacting, the third I saw alone about a minute later and had a red light). Was too dark for me to even make out much of a shape since they were very small (or maybe the body minus the lights was invisible or cloaked?)
 
They moved too quickly to be drones. Plus it's past midnight and I've never seen anyone flying drones around here.  Obviously weren't lights from a plane since at their lowest they were like 5 ft from the ground. I can't think of anything else they could possibly be! They each disappeared after a few seconds as well, or at least the lights were no longer on. 

Location is the far south side of chicago! Anyone else see them? I know it's a long shot, it's late and it's cold. I was only outside to smoke some weed but I saw them before I even had time to light up.

Text: Sighting: Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 6:45 PM, December 27, 2022. I feel so so so dumb I didn’t take my cellphone outside with me. EDIT: some spelling and grammar mistakes 

My partner was outside my house smoking and poked his head in. He asked what planets we could see from the house, and I told him, and he was like: “are any of them bright green?” Dumbfounded, I went outside and looked up where he indicated, in the western sky behind my house. Whatever he had seen was gone and he was like “it was right there.” It was a cloudy night with patches of clear sky. The clouds were moving pretty quickly, and revealed a big green star in the sky. Except it moved. I said: “I don’t think that’s a star”. A minute later it jumped altitude - I don’t know how high, I know nothing about altitudes aside from typical meteorological cloud heights - but one minute it was in one spot in the sky and the next it was way higher. I got excited and tapped him on the shoulder to look, but it blinked out of sight. I scanned the sky to see if it would come back. Out front of the house, to the southeast, more clouds cleared and I watched a big blue/whitish light moving at plane height. “I think that’s a plane,” I said to him. Almost as soon as I said that, it stopped dead, changed shape slightly from a ball-like/light shape to something elongated, back into a circle shape, and began to fly in a circle, vertically. I hope that makes sense - I mean in a circle vertically/counterclockwise I could see looking at it dead on not in a round/searching circle horizontally like a helicopter. Clouds covered it. I scanned the sky again - it appeared in the first location I’d seen it but further away, and traveled almost an identical path. It stopped dead again and hovered, reversed, then flew in a zig zag pattern. 

The cloud cover grew too thick and though I stayed out a little longer I didn’t see anything else. I was excited and whispering like “Hi! Come back!” very excitedly because I’d never seen anything like it before, and behind me my boyfriend was becoming more and more frightened/agitated and he actually dragged me back into the house. 
When we came back inside my boyfriend immediately threw up in the bathroom. My heart was beating like I’d just ran a marathon and I was elated. But within an hour I developed a terrible headache that I still have two hours after seeing the object. It has not gone away and I still feel a little nauseous.

Before anyone asks, yes I’ve checked my carbon monoxide levels - we have new batteries in the detector and I tested it a week ago so it’s still working. We did not consume any hallucinogens, and he was smoking a non nicotine (non THC!) cigarette. (He’s trying to quit). I had no alcohol, had just drank water actually, and we had not eaten any of the same things that day yet - I work from home, he works outside of the home, and I hadn’t finished making dinner when this occurred. 

I will freely admit I have been looking into methods to try and make contact/communicate with non-human entities - even way far out methods that I wasn’t sure I believed, so I guess something I tried worked?? Only way to know for sure is to try again, so I will attempt the same method again - on a night I’m not feeling sick. I’m pretty stoked about it still even though I feel ill. My boyfriend was completely freaked and I’m kind of sad because I only got good vibes from the whole experience. I think it would be incredible to make contact with something outside of our normal way of life. 


TLDR: saw one or two very strange crafts outside tonight that did some very non-typical non-aircraft-like things. Not drunk or high or poisoned by carbon monoxide. I still feel sick after witnessing.

I’m in a flight path for MIA and at first through it was a plane without its lights on. Then it swerved back. The central v shape was very dynamic and dark but it was surrounded by fair tiny lights, did a loop and went out of sight. It looked almost bird like followed/surrounded by a mesh of fireflies.

It was flying low and slow.  Maybe 30 stories up. I wish to God I would've just pulled over and shot a video of it. It was huge, long and shaped somewhat like a formula 1 race car, meaning that it had these compartments that protruded outwardly. 

It was just too surreal and I brushed it off as I figured "there's no way this it what I think it is"".... Looking back

I was on the beach in Cape Canaveral for the launch of the Falcon Heavy on Tuesday 11/1. With my naked eye I saw a stationary dark orb in the sky (pic taken at 9:48 a.m.) It was not a bird, plane or helicopter. iPhones take terrible photos from a distance. The first photo is the original, the second is a zoomed-in version so the dark orb can be seen. Obviously you can take the original and zoom in yourself... the orb is just above the clouds which are slightly below and to the right of the sun. (I am NOT referring to the blue dot lower right which is some kind of reflection of the sun on my camera lens) It was especially interesting that it happened during a rocket launch.  I'm thrilled to finally see one for myself.

I was listening to some music while we walked as is our normal routine. Where I live though puts me pretty squarely in town so I don't have the greatest view of the sky at times with light pollution. That night though there was a very red light I didn't recognize as one of the stars I normally do see. It was solid red, unblinking. I've seen helicopters at night before and I know planes lights blink but this was not that at all. It moved from my perspective slowly about 2 feet across the sky before it finally went so far away that I could no longer see it.

Text: Well I'm going to add mine here since I have no photo or footage.  My office window looks at another building and clear bluebird sky with small clouds scattered about. 

I was at my desk on the phone talking to my brother and I saw a white orb. Basically the brightest cleanest white possible. It entered my view and  within a second entered the cloud going left to right. It was going fairly fast so, I wanted to see it exit the cloud. The end of the cloud was obscured by an air unit on the building across from my office window.  When it didn't exit on the predicted straight line path, I stood up at my desk still on the phone and explained to him I saw an orb. As I was able to see it again it had turned back left and up and away vanishing in distant blue sky. 

Of course being extremely curious I basically left my work and went out the back of the building to try and see it or make sense of it.  So that's that and now I'm just watching out the window instead of doing my job. Atleast I'm the department manager.

Text: June 28 at ~4:25 am EST, Willoughby, Ohio

Had just watched the ISS go across the sky and was looking for a different rocket when I noticed a dark, spherical object zipping along. The object appeared to be significantly lower in altitude than a jet, and was going very fast - but slow enough for me to watch it travel in a straight line for maybe ten seconds. It didn’t make any noise. I believe it was traveling south to north, or at least heading north-ish. My sense of direction isn’t great, haha.

Then it started swinging left and right while moving in it’s direction.. ok strange but not so much. Then it stopped. And didn’t move for the 15 mins I observed it. Another odd thing is that it stopped at a point where it made a triangle with another 2 bright objects.

Text: I've seen a red dot in sky moving fast before coming to a halt and then moving left and right and finally coming down slowly before the view was obstructed by a house and disappearing out of sight.

This could've not been an aircraft due to its strange movements and I checked flightradar24 and found nothing. It also could've not been a drone since the UFO was high in the sky and above the clouds.

I've tried searching everywhere and can't find an answer but only posts of other people experiencing the same thing. I'm baffled and tbh not even sure what I've seen. I'm not gonna jump straight into saying it's an extraterrestrial and first see what other people think about this.

Text: I was in Seattle during an outdoor concert. Saw an odd point light in the sky that had a comet like appearance (bright with a tail). I watched vaguely intrigued for couple of seconds and the tail disappeared. It was traveling steadily across the sky (similar to a plane not like satellite). The point light seemed to gradually fade in intensity which I at first attributed to passing behind the spotted clouds. I only stared at it a few moments more and realize the clouds had nothing to do with the variation in it’s brightness. It reached the far side of the of the sky(approx 120 degrees from where I started observing and grew in intensity so it was a very bright point light and no doubt not related to the cloud cover. At that moment it began to steadily decrease in intensity, fading out to nothing and disappearing over several seconds. Immediately after disappearing, three unique helicopters (I think) - very military like - appeared in the area, brightly lit with a triangular lighting pattern. They briefly encircled the general area the light had occupied and then left. This was the first time I’ve ever noticed something so odd in the sky. Have no explanation, brief experience, not particularly spectacular,  but I cannot stop thinking about it. Another women at the concert next to me stopped me later and said that she saw the same thing and was also amazed (so not just me and my boyfriend).

Text: Hi, can anyone explain?? I've come to share one thing and one thing only, after this I'm gone and that's it. I need to understand what this was and dig deeper, but after I have to move on. I have no pictures or videos but I DID TAKE VIDEOS AS IS HAPPENED, and since deleted them because it was over a year later and they weren't very good/totally freaked me out. 

So, it was probably summer the first time. A few years ago, I don't remember. I was still in highschool, so it must have been... 2017 or 2018. 

I remember the experience quite well, though. It was a clear night, the sky a lighter shade of navy, not jet black. The moon was to my left, I think it was about 4:00 or 5:00 judging on the position of the moon being well past midnight. There's a maple tree in front of the house, slightly to the right. 

I caught sight of a bright, bright light past the drawn curtains, and looking out the windows, I saw it. A ton of incredibly bright white light broken through the maple's leaves. I did think it was the moon at first. But the moon was on the other side of the sky. And this was brighter, and it didn't fome from one place, it seemed there were dozens of lights.

Through the tree, I also spotted those smooth, muscular patterns, like on muscle cars. Those wavy metalic ribs. The object also darted around at different speeds and angles, but was flat appearing in regaurds to how it moved: it only moved horizontally and not at all vertically.

At some point I also glimpsed a portion of it veering so far right that it was no longer hidden. The lights were dazzlingly bright and legitimately blinded me momentarily, however, I realized it was swiveling the lights around. It seemed to take the lights away in a different direction that I was, so it wasn't blinding me, and they were mostly pointed straight downwards.

It slowly veered out of sight behind the roof of the house and I wasn't brave enough to get outside to look at it. But before it slid away, I clearly, very very clearly, saw that it looked exactly as I thought. Dark, possibly straight black, with wavy metalic ribs (like on muscle cars) on the bottom, and as many as 50 huge, very ultra-bright, focused, swiveling lights. Each brighter than the moon and lighting up the neighbors house and the tree and the fence. It was as large as a football field and possibly 100, 150 feet high, considering the probably 50-75 foot tall trees surrounding the area. 

The second time was when I captured the videos, lost now. Everything was similar, about the same time of night, similar moon position, and the thing was behind the tree again. It seems to love to hide behind that tree lol. Broken light filtering through the tree, and the thing was there with the same shape and size and I could see some of the muscley-ribs on the underside of it. 

I took out my phone and recoreded a 10 minute video, poor quality, all you could see was a clear navy backdrop behind a tree with eerie light slipping through the branches. It slipped behind the house again and I gave up. After deciding it was 'safe,' I went to go sleep. But it was lingering on my mind and my heart was pounding. So I went back to the window, found it there, and recorded a second, slightly better quality 50-some second video, where you could catch a glimpse of the muscle on the object's underside for a brief moment. 

Both before and since, I've occasionally seen glimpses of eerie red or bright white light arranged in triangular formations very, very high in the sky above. They move swiftly and flatly (horizontally), and stay in formation throughout. They can be fast or slow. My brother convinced me they were satelites and I thought so for years, but I'm not so sure anymore. 

I also see plenty of choppers, annoying freaking choppers at night, usually well after midnight, usually during the warmer months or even spring. They are loud and circle the neighborhood, and I do have to admit ot my being in Northern Michigan where every 5 minutes there's another lake, and there's one in my neighborhood and the bay of Lake Michigan isn't too far, either. So it could be the coastgaurd, but I have an eerie and intangible suspicion that it's somehoe related to the UFO... I can't explain, but it seems too... specific. And too... coincidental. I also sometimes see these things and then that exact night, usually 20-40 minutes after, I'll hear the choppers and can often see them, and they're... so fast... for whatever reason the coastgaurd would be racing and tearing through my neighborhood at 2:00 am, 30 mins after seeing a very possible UFO sighting?? 

I don't usually go outside after dark. I bravened up once and did, but saw nothing, yet I was too scared to try again. I'd say every 2 or 3 weeks I see the 'satellites.' Several times weekly I see the 'coastgaurd.' And everytime I've seen the 'satellites,' the 'coastgaurd' always appeared shortly thereafter... 

So ahhhh... lol, am I safe??

Idk.

Oh and before leaving, genuine question: sometimes when I was a kid, I'd hear faint noises, like classical piano or standard radio or animal noises or ringing in my ears, but it seemed like it was faint, only ever at night, and it seemed... purposeful. Intentional. Everytime I experienced this, without any failure at all, no joke, I would see the 'satellites,' outside my bedroom window. Has anyone experinced THAT. Or an I actually just scitzophrenic?

Here's the thing: my therapist says I don't seem crazy. I'm just depressed right now, but that's itm she's checked me out and screened me for scitzophreniabefore, but told me I didn't seem delusional at all (about other things, monstly paranormal). Although get this: I'm Christian. Yeah, I don't believe in any of this stuff, I'm just so shaken that I don't really have a better idea right now, and for all the prayer in the world, I keep turning up blank. Sorry, God. Not trying to be rude, just wanna figure this out. 

Anyway, goodnight. It's 3:56 am rn and I'm tired as all heck.

Text: Just spotted this object this morning.  And I want to share it.  

Possibly first spotted around 8:30am by my mom. I wasn't woken up until around 9:00am.  I was told a UFO was outside and the curtains were pulled open and I was told to look, and I spotted a dot in the sky.  I then looked at the object with the binoculars and would definitely say it was a black triangle object with yellow lights. I took my first picture of the object at 9:06am.  

In the binoculars the object was very clear but the phone and camera couldn't pick up the object very well.   
It was a black triangle with 5 lights in all.  But the lights would be in different patterns and sequences. e.g 1,2,3, and back to 1 light patten.  E.g. 3 lights in triangle. 4 lights in a square. The lights were yellow. .   
Around 9:20am, we moved into the garden to continue watching the object.
At about 9:27am we started spotting white dots flying around the object and moving very fast away.  I did catch one of these white dots moving away very fast on video at 9:42am. 
At about 9:35am when using the binoculars I did see a white dot appear from the object and fly towards the sun, where I then lost it.  

Overall the object was motionless for 10 mins in the sky, and then spent 30 mins moving away slowly.  Until and I do find it odd that we had 2 spotter planes flying around 9:45am and that's when this object then disappeared.  Coincidence, almost likely.

Text: July 9th, 10:35 PM, North of Rochester, MN.

Red light in the sky headed SE to NW.  At first I thought it was a lantern with a candle in it but it was too high and moving too fast.  Moving about the speed of a satellite.  It would flare up every so often and as it moved farther north crossing the sky, it disappeared or flamed out.  It resembled a rocket possibly?  There was no debris trail or anything coming off of it and it wasn’t red like a light on a plane but more of a red flame color.  I tried to take a picture but phone cameras just can’t do that well at night and it’s red blob.

Randomly I pan up and I caught something - a white dot shooting into frame from top, and then stopping dead. Problem is, I didn't realise it at the time (seeing tiny white dots on a smallish phone screen you're not even looking at because its over your head is quite hard) but you can definitely see it on a computer and its what made me pause. But ultimately, its a white dot the shoots in crazy fast and stops dead and then 1 second later I pan back away and I don't think you see it ever again. Doesn't seem like its worth sharing - I mean, bugs don't stop dead in mid air do they from a screaming speed?

Text: Had a sighting off of Good Harbor Bay on August 1st around 8:30 PM. Very rapid movement between Sleeping Bear Point and South Manitou Island. The ufo made vertical movements, to the point where it appeared to almost touch Lake Michigan, hovered in place and moved rapidly north and south on a couple of occasions before going out of sight. Anyone else catch this? Post sighting we heard a helicopter and a jet. Two very unusual things to hear in this area. The Canadian freighter Michipicoten was in the vicinity at the time too as well as a sailboat named Utah. If anyone has connections to these vessels people on board may have experienced the sighting as well. Saw it with my sister and all in all it was approximately a 3 to 5 minute event.

Text: 12/25 at around 6 pm, southern New England. Facing northeast. Saw what at first looked like two satellites traveling slowly across the sky, at a fair distance from each other, but sometimes getting further or closer to one another (so probably not a part of the same craft). One light was blue ish, the other one red ish. When they were passing directly overhead they suddenly just stopped and hovered there, bobbing slightly like a boat in the water. I watched them for a couple minutes, but they didn’t move from that position. Would’ve stayed looking longer but it was goddamn freezing. Wondering if anyone saw something similar that night

Text: Hello,
I am posting this here as I feel this is the right place to ask.

A couple of months ago I was outside at night playing basketball with some friends and as we were about to leave I had to take a leak and as I was, I look into the sky and see these series of small lights that from my perspective looked very far away. They were small white lights that would appear out of nowhere, travel for around 10 seconds at a pretty high speed and then disappear. In total there was around 20 of them from the time I looked up and they were equally spaced apart. They would all appear in the same spot and then disappear at another spot. I’m curious as to what these lights were and if anyone can provide any other details or information if they have either saw the same  thing, or if it is a particular space project that I am unfamiliar with. 

Thank you for reading.
