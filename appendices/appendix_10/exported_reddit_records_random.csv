They were very small, each had a blinking light (the first two yellowish, I saw them at the same time and they seemed to be interacting, the third I saw alone about a minute later and had a red light). Was too dark for me to even make out much of a shape since they were very small (or maybe the body minus the lights was invisible or cloaked?)
 
They moved too quickly to be drones. Plus it's past midnight and I've never seen anyone flying drones around here.  Obviously weren't lights from a plane since at their lowest they were like 5 ft from the ground. I can't think of anything else they could possibly be! They each disappeared after a few seconds as well, or at least the lights were no longer on.

I feel so so so dumb I didn’t take my cellphone outside with me. EDIT: some spelling and grammar mistakes 

My partner was outside my house smoking and poked his head in. He asked what planets we could see from the house, and I told him, and he was like: “are any of them bright green?” Dumbfounded, I went outside and looked up where he indicated, in the western sky behind my house. Whatever he had seen was gone and he was like “it was right there.” It was a cloudy night with patches of clear sky. The clouds were moving pretty quickly, and revealed a big green star in the sky. Except it moved. I said: “I don’t think that’s a star”. A minute later it jumped altitude - I don’t know how high, I know nothing about altitudes aside from typical meteorological cloud heights - but one minute it was in one spot in the sky and the next it was way higher. I got excited and tapped him on the shoulder to look, but it blinked out of sight. I scanned the sky to see if it would come back. Out front of the house, to the southeast, more clouds cleared and I watched a big blue/whitish light moving at plane height. “I think that’s a plane,” I said to him. Almost as soon as I said that, it stopped dead, changed shape slightly from a ball-like/light shape to something elongated, back into a circle shape, and began to fly in a circle, vertically. I hope that makes sense - I mean in a circle vertically/counterclockwise I could see looking at it dead on not in a round/searching circle horizontally like a helicopter. Clouds covered it. I scanned the sky again - it appeared in the first location I’d seen it but further away, and traveled almost an identical path. It stopped dead again and hovered, reversed, then flew in a zig zag pattern. 

The cloud cover grew too thick and though I stayed out a little longer I didn’t see anything else. I was excited and whispering like “Hi! Come back!” very excitedly because I’d never seen anything like it before, and behind me my boyfriend was becoming more and more frightened/agitated and he actually dragged me back into the house. 
When we came back inside my boyfriend immediately threw up in the bathroom. My heart was beating like I’d just ran a marathon and I was elated. But within an hour I developed a terrible headache that I still have two hours after seeing the object. It has not gone away and I still feel a little nauseous.

Before anyone asks, yes I’ve checked my carbon monoxide levels - we have new batteries in the detector and I tested it a week ago so it’s still working. We did not consume any hallucinogens, and he was smoking a non nicotine (non THC!) cigarette. (He’s trying to quit). I had no alcohol, had just drank water actually, and we had not eaten any of the same things that day yet - I work from home, he works outside of the home, and I hadn’t finished making dinner when this occurred. 

I will freely admit I have been looking into methods to try and make contact/communicate with non-human entities - even way far out methods that I wasn’t sure I believed, so I guess something I tried worked?? Only way to know for sure is to try again, so I will attempt the same method again - on a night I’m not feeling sick. I’m pretty stoked about it still even though I feel ill. My boyfriend was completely freaked and I’m kind of sad because I only got good vibes from the whole experience. I think it would be incredible to make contact with something outside of our normal way of life.
