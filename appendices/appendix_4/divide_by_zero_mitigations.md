# Mitigations to divide-by-zero issues when calculating precision, recall and F1-Score

- If no entities were identified by NER – hence true positives were zero – and both false positives and false negatives were also zero, then values for precision, recall and F1-score were all recorded as 1. This is correct, since although there were no true positives to detect, NER did not incorrectly identify any entities (false positives), nor did it fail to identify any entity in the annotated data (false negatives).
- If no entities were identified by NER – hence true positives were zero – but false positives were greater than zero, then precision, recall and F1-score were all recorded as zero. In this case, no correct NER identification was made, however entities were incorrectly identified. It follows that precision must be zero, whilst recall must also be zero as there no entities existed in the annotated data to correctly recalled.
- If no entities were identified by NER – hence true positives were zero – yet false negatives were greater than zero, then precision, recall and F1-score were all recorded as zero. In this case, no correct NER identification was made, whilst all annotated entities were missed by NER, resulting in the zero recall count. Precision must again be zero, as no entities were correctly identified by NER.
